## Factual Grounding Rules (MANDATORY)
1. ONLY use facts, names, and claims that appear in the Reference Materials provided below.
2. If the Reference Materials do not cover a subtopic, write "해당 주제에 대한 검증된 정보가 부족합니다" (KO) or "Verified information on this topic is limited" (EN) instead of generating from memory.
3. NEVER fabricate:
   - System names, protocol names, or framework names
   - Paper titles, arXiv IDs, author names, or publication venues
   - Mathematical formulas that are not standard textbook knowledge or from references
   - Benchmark numbers, performance metrics, or statistics not in references
   - Product-technology mappings ("X uses Y") unless confirmed in references
4. Only add disambiguation notes ("~와 혼동하지 않도록" / "Not to be confused with X") for VERIFIABLE alternative meanings that are WELL-KNOWN (e.g., "Kernel in CNN vs OS"). Do NOT invent disambiguation targets.
5. Reference URLs in adv_*_8_refs MUST come from the Reference Materials. Do NOT generate URLs from memory.
6. For formulas: only include formulas you can derive step-by-step. If you cannot explain each symbol, do not include it.
7. NO inline source citations in body text. Do NOT write "(출처: IBM)", "(Ref: X)", "(IBM Research)", "(Refs: Encord, Arize)" etc. in the content. Sources belong ONLY in the "더 깊이 알고 싶다면" / "Go Deeper" section as curated recommendations.

DOMAIN CONTEXT:
- This handbook covers AI/IT/CS terms. Focus on the AI/IT meaning of each term.
- Many terms exist in multiple fields (e.g., "Entropy" in information theory vs thermodynamics, "Kernel" in CNN vs OS, "Agent" in AI vs real estate). Always write from the AI/IT perspective first.
- If a term is used in other fields, briefly note the difference to prevent confusion (e.g., "Not to be confused with thermodynamic entropy").
- Base your writing on established facts from official documentation, papers, and widely-accepted definitions. Do not speculate or include unverified claims.
""" + GROUNDING_RULES + """
LANGUAGE RULE:
- Fields ending in `_ko`: Korean headers and Korean body text. Technical terms (Transformer, API, fine-tuning) may remain in English where natural in Korean tech writing.
- Do NOT use bilingual headers like "한국어 / English". Korean only.

## Page Architecture (important — determines what goes where)

This handbook page has FIVE rendering zones. Your output fields map to them:

1. **Hero Card** (always visible above level switcher): `definition_ko` + `hero_news_context_ko`.
   The user arriving from a news article must be able to "graduate" from this card in ~15 seconds without scrolling into the body.
2. **Basic body** (shown when user toggles Basic): 7 sections `basic_ko_1_plain` ... `basic_ko_7_related`.
3. **Advanced body** (shown when user toggles Advanced): generated in a separate call. Do NOT produce advanced fields here.
4. **References footer** (always visible below body, level-independent): `references_ko` JSON array.

## Learner Popup Summary
- `summary_ko` is a learner-facing popup summary shown outside the full handbook page.
- Write 3~5 short sentences in Korean.
- It should be shorter and easier than `basic_ko_1_plain`, but more explanatory than `definition_ko`.
- Cover: what it is, how it basically works, and why it matters.
- A useful default flow is: what it is → an intuition or analogy (if it genuinely helps) → how it basically works → why it matters.
- You do NOT have to force that exact order if the term reads more naturally another way.
- Use one intuitive analogy or everyday comparison when it genuinely improves comprehension.
- Skip the analogy for product names, standards, policy terms, or cases where an analogy would feel forced or misleading.
- Prefer concrete everyday images like "reception desk", "traffic controller", "recipe", "translator", or "librarian" over abstract metaphors.
- No markdown headings, no bullet lists, no code, no formulas.
- Do not sound like a spec, design doc, benchmark report, or API reference.
- Avoid jargon-heavy words unless unavoidable. If you must use a technical word, explain it immediately in plain language.
- Avoid these phrases and tones: "JSON schema", "latency budget", "validation pipeline", "execution boundary", "throughput gain", "benchmark", "architecture", "orchestration" unless the term cannot be explained without them.

GOOD style example:
- "함수 호출은 AI가 필요한 도구를 골라 사람 대신 버튼을 눌러보게 만드는 방식이라고 생각하면 된다. 식당에서 주문을 받는 직원이 메뉴를 고르고 주방에 전달하는 것처럼, 모델은 어떤 함수를 쓸지와 필요한 인자를 정리해 앱에 넘긴다. 실제 실행은 앱이 맡기 때문에 잘못된 요청을 걸러낼 수 있다. 그래서 채팅이 설명만 하는 것을 넘어 실제 행동으로 이어질 수 있다."

BAD style example:
- "함수 호출은 LLM이 JSON schema에 맞는 인자를 생성하고 host application이 validation pipeline을 통해 실행하는 메커니즘이다. 이는 tool orchestration과 execution boundary를 분리해 latency budget을 관리하는 데 유리하다."

## Handbook Categories (choose 1-3, priority order)
cs-fundamentals, math-statistics, ml-fundamentals, deep-learning, llm-genai, data-engineering, infra-hardware, safety-ethics, products-platforms

## Term Name Fields
- term_full: English full name (e.g., "Long Short-Term Memory" for LSTM). Same as term if no abbreviation.
- korean_name: Korean translation or commonly used Korean name, written in Hangul. If NO standard Korean term exists for this concept, return an **empty string `""`** — do NOT invent a phonetic transliteration of the English word. "인디나스" is NOT a valid korean_name for "Internals"; Korean engineers either write the concept as "내부 구조" or leave it as "Internals". A phonetic form is acceptable only when Korean tech writing genuinely uses it (e.g., "트랜스포머" for Transformer, "파이토치" for PyTorch — both appear regularly in Korean press; "인디나스" does not).
  - korean_name identical to the English term is allowed ONLY for: versioned model names (e.g., "GPT-5", "Claude 4.6"), all-caps technical abbreviations (e.g., "LSTM", "RAG", "BERT"), and ISO/IEEE-style standards. For every other term, if no real Korean translation exists, return korean_name="" rather than copying the English.
- korean_full: Korean formal name (e.g., "장단기 기억 네트워크" for LSTM). Same as korean_name if identical.

## Term Name Few-Shot Examples
- Prefer a standard Korean translation for `korean_name` when one exists.
- Use phonetic transcription only when a standard Korean translation is not commonly used.
- `korean_full` may add an English parenthetical when that helps disambiguate the formal name.

## definition_ko / definition_en (1-2 sentences, encyclopedia-lede style)

Precise, technical definition. Shared across both levels.

**Structure (1 sentence is the default; 2 is the exception):**
- **Default: exactly 1 sentence** in encyclopedia-lede style — definition + conceptual mechanism packed via subordinate clauses, commas, and em-dashes. Think Wikipedia's opening line ("X is a Y that does Z through W") rather than an academic abstract with multiple short sentences.
- **Optional 2nd sentence** allowed ONLY when it contributes a *distinct chunk* that cannot naturally fit in sentence 1 — typical fits are: a key operational context, an important caveat/boundary, or a common pairing — and the total stays within the length target.
- **Required content in sentence 1:**
  1. Technical definition — what this concept *is*, in domain vocabulary.
  2. Mechanism hint — *how* it works conceptually (via subordinate clause).
- **Never split into 3+ sentences.** If you're reaching for a 3rd sentence, you're over-explaining — move that content into `body_advanced`.
- **NO filler phrases** ("in essence", "simply put", "essentially", "at its core", "in machine learning,", "put another way").
- **NO repetition** of the same idea in different words — every clause must add new information.
- **NO marketing tone** ("revolutionary", "powerful", "state-of-the-art" without a concrete metric).
- **Depth floor:** if the draft is under ~150 chars EN or ~100 chars KO, it's too thin — expand the mechanism hint.
- **Target length:** ~280-420 chars EN, ~150-230 chars KO. Simple terms land closer to the lower bound as 1 sentence; complex terms may use a 2nd sentence and land closer to the upper bound.
- **Scope discipline — no enumeration, no algorithmic detail:** Definition stays at **"what it is + how it works at a conceptual level"**.
  - **No enumerations** (4+ items of any kind): primitives, pipeline stages, RFC numbers, API endpoints, feature lists, product variants, transport details. These belong in `body_advanced`.
  - **Conceptual mechanism is OK; algorithmic detail is NOT.** A definition's mechanism clause describes the *idea*, not the computation.
    - CONCEPTUAL (OK — describes the idea at a level any practitioner can picture):
      - "a student network learns by imitating the teacher's behavior"
      - "optimized against a reward model learned from human preferences"
      - "processes tokens in parallel through self-attention"
    - ALGORITHMIC (MOVE to body_advanced — describes the computation):
      - Math ops: "logits are multiplied by a temperature factor", "softmax applied to scaled logits"
      - Step sequences: "first train the reward model on preference pairs, then run PPO with KL regularization"
      - Named computational functions inside the definition: `softmax`, `KL-divergence`, `cross-entropy`, `leave-one-out`, `autoregressive next-token prediction`
      - Process variables: "gradients", "weights update via Adam", "learning rate schedule"
    - Rule of thumb: if a reader could *implement* the term from your definition, it's too detailed — pull that content into body_advanced.

This definition is surfaced in TWO places — both benefit from crisp 5-8 second reads, not paragraphs:
1. Hero Card on the handbook detail page (canonical technical summary).
2. News-page Expert popup as "quick technical reference" while reading articles — readers should absorb it without losing news-reading momentum.

Must be:
- Technically accurate, using domain vocabulary without unpacking everything.
- Scannable: complete thoughts, no mid-sentence code or formulas.
- Distinct from `body_basic §1`: basic uses analogies and everyday language; definition uses technical vocabulary.
- Distinct from `body_advanced §1`: advanced goes deep into internals; definition stays at summary level.

GOOD (definition_ko — concept, 1 sentence):
"과적합은 모델이 훈련 데이터의 잡음까지 학습해 새 데이터에서 일반화에 실패하는 상태로, 모델 capacity 가 데이터가 제약할 수 있는 범위를 넘을 때 발생하며 정규화 기법으로 완화한다."
→ Passes: 1 sentence with comma-linked clauses. Definition + mechanism + high-level mitigation pointer. Does NOT enumerate specific mitigations (dropout/weight decay/early stopping).

BAD (definition_ko — too thin, missing mechanism):
"훈련 데이터에는 잘 맞지만 새 데이터에서는 성능이 급락하는 현상. 모델이 신호 대신 잡음까지 학습해 일반화에 실패한 상태."
→ Rejected: 2 sentences but they restate the same idea twice. Zero mechanism.
  Fix: rewrite as a single sentence packing definition + capacity-vs-dataset mechanism + high-level mitigation.

GOOD (definition_en — concept, 1 sentence):
"Overfitting is a generalization failure where a model absorbs training-data noise as if it were signal — training loss keeps decreasing while predictions collapse on unseen inputs — and is prevented through regularization methods applied during training."
→ Passes: 1 sentence with em-dash aside. Packs definition + observed signal + high-level mitigation without enumerating specific techniques.

BAD (definition_en — too thin):
"Overfitting means a model memorizes training data and fails on new inputs."
→ Rejected: 1 sentence but no mechanism, no mitigation pointer. Add the capacity-vs-constraint mechanism and at least a high-level mitigation reference.

GOOD (definition_en — architecture, 1 sentence):
"Transformer is a neural network architecture that processes sequence tokens in parallel through self-attention, replacing RNN-style recurrence with a position-aware attention stack and enabling efficient scaling to billions of parameters with long-range dependency modeling."
→ Passes: 1 sentence. Definition + mechanism + scaling consequence packed with coordination. Does NOT list encoder/decoder/FFN/multi-head as separate components.

GOOD (definition_en — training technique, 2 sentences for richer mechanism):
"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a post-training alignment technique that optimizes a language model against a reward model learned from human preference comparisons, steering outputs toward helpful behavior where explicit objective functions are impractical to define. It builds on a supervised fine-tuning baseline and applies regularization at the response level to prevent over-optimization against the proxy reward."
→ Passes: 2 sentences because the second adds a distinct chunk (SFT baseline + response-level regularization caveat) that would overload sentence 1. Does NOT list SFT + reward-model training + PPO as a pipeline.

GOOD (definition_en — protocol/spec, 2 sentences for role clarity):
"Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open JSON-RPC standard that lets AI applications connect to external tools and data through a uniform discovery-and-authorization flow, replacing one-off per-tool integrations with a shared protocol. It defines three roles — host, client, server — so any compliant AI host can plug in new tools without custom adapter code."
→ Passes: 2 sentences because the role triple is a distinct chunk — but NO RFC numbers, no primitive lists (resources/tools/sampling/...), no transport details.

GOOD (definition_en — infrastructure tool, 1 sentence):
"PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework that builds computation graphs dynamically at runtime — letting developers define and modify model architectures with standard Python control flow — prioritizing research flexibility over static graph optimization."
→ Passes: 1 sentence with em-dash aside. Definition + mechanism + design-philosophy tradeoff. Does NOT list autograd/distributed/TorchScript features.

GOOD (definition_en — product/service, 2 sentences for surface + distribution):
"Claude is Anthropic's family of large language models aligned through constitutional AI training, which encodes behavior guidelines as explicit written rules rather than deriving them from preference data alone. It is offered both as a consumer chat assistant and as a developer API for long-context reasoning and agentic workflows."
→ Passes: 2 sentences because the distribution surface (consumer vs API) is a distinct chunk. Does NOT list variants (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) or version history.

Pattern across all six GOOD examples: **1-sentence default (encyclopedia lede), 2 sentences when the 2nd adds a distinct chunk worth its own sentence**. NEVER an enumeration of internal components, pipeline stages, primitives, RFCs, features, variants, or named sub-offerings in the definition — no matter the term type.

---

## Hero fields (level-independent, shown above level switcher)

- **hero_news_context_ko**: **"뉴스에서 이렇게 쓰여"** — 뉴스에서 이 용어가 등장하는 대표 맥락 **정확히 3줄**.
  형식: `"인용구" → 이런 뜻`. 줄 사이는 `\\n`. 각 줄은 카드에 한 줄로 들어가야 하므로 짧게 — 가급적 60자 이내, 길어도 70자를 넘지 않게.
  사용자가 뉴스 기사를 읽다가 이 카드만 보고도 "아 이런 뜻이었구나" 하고 원래 기사로 돌아갈 수 있어야 함.
  **인라인 출처 금지** — "(IBM Research)" 같은 괄호 출처를 넣지 마.
  GOOD: `"Transformer 기반" → 이 아키텍처 위에 만들었다는 뜻, 최신 LLM 거의 다 해당\\n"attention layer를 확장" → 이 연산 블록을 더 쌓았다는 뜻\\n"parallel 처리로 빠름" → 단어를 한번에 처리해 RNN보다 수백배 빠름`
  BAD: 긴 설명조, 한 줄이 60자 초과, 4줄 이상, 뉴스 인용구 없이 단순 정의 반복.

---

## body_basic — 기초 (7개 섹션)

Target audience: Non-engineers. PM, designers, executives, students. A middle schooler should be able to understand it.
Tone: Friendly, approachable. Like explaining to a smart friend with no tech background.
Rule: NO code, NO complex formulas, NO jargon without immediate explanation.

**FAIL CONDITIONS** — 아래 중 하나라도 해당하면 섹션이 반려됨:
- 설명 없이 영어 약어·전문 용어 등장 (예: "RLHF를 통해…" 설명 없이)
- Hero card의 한 줄 정의를 거의 그대로 복제한 §1 (hero는 이미 보여줬으므로 §1은 더 깊어야 함)
- 비유만 있고 **구체 메커니즘** 1~2문장이 없음 (비유는 시작점일 뿐)
- `basic_ko_2_example` 에 스마트폰·자율주행·음성비서 같은 **진부한 포괄 예시** 사용 (금지 목록)
- 하드코딩된 수치 없이 "빠르다/느리다/크다/작다" 같은 추상 비교만 (`basic_ko_3_glance` 에서는 구체 수치 필수)
- References가 본문 bullet으로 나열됨 (references_ko footer 전용)
- 섹션 간 동일 비유/예시 반복 (각 섹션 unique 정보 원칙 위반)

### Adaptive content for phenomenon/problem terms

Some terms describe a PROBLEM or PHENOMENON (e.g., Hallucination, Overfitting, Data Drift) rather than a technology or tool. For these terms, adapt the section CONTENT to fit naturally:
- `basic_ko_4_impact`: write about where this problem OCCURS and what real damage it causes, not where it is "used"
Keep the same section KEYS — only adapt the content perspective.

### Section key descriptions (Korean — basic_ko_*):

Each section MUST contain UNIQUE information — do NOT repeat the same examples, analogies, or points across sections. The hero card already answered "what is it in one line + how it shows up in news" — the body must go deeper, not restate.

- **basic_ko_1_plain** (쉽게 이해하기):
  이 개념이 해결하는 **문제**가 뭔지 먼저 설명하고, 그 다음 해결 방식을 비유로 설명. "X라는 문제가 있었는데, Y 방식으로 해결하는 게 바로 이 개념이다" 구조.
  비유 뒤에 **구체적 메커니즘** 1~2문장 필수 — "왜 그렇게 작동하는지"가 빠지면 안 됨.

  **구조 요건:**
  - 단락 2~3개 (기본 3개 권장: ① 문제 배경 ② 해결 방식 + 비유 ③ 메커니즘 디테일. 개념이 단순해 3개가 인위적이면 2개도 허용)
  - 각 단락 **최소 3문장**
  - 전체에 비유 1개 + 구체적 디테일(숫자·예시·이름) 1개 이상
  - 단락을 **빈 줄 (`\\n\\n`)** 로 구분 — 소프트 브레이크(`\\n`) 금지
  - **반려 조건**: 단락 1개로 몰아쓰기 / 각 단락이 2문장 이하 / 비유 없이 정의만 나열

  헤더 없음 — 본문만.

  **hero_news_context와 중복 금지** — hero는 "뉴스 인용구"에 집중, 여기는 "문제 → 해결 → 메커니즘" 내러티브에 집중.
  BAD: "AI 칩은 전문 주방처럼 빠르게 처리합니다." (비유만 있고 왜 빠른지 없음)
  GOOD: "CPU는 계산을 순서대로 하나씩 처리합니다. 그런데 AI는 수백만 개의 숫자를 동시에 곱하고 더해야 합니다. AI 칩은 이 행렬 곱셈을 한 번에 수천 개씩 처리하도록 회로 자체가 설계된 겁니다." (비유 + 메커니즘)

- **basic_ko_2_example** (비유와 예시, **시나리오 정확히 3개**):
  이 개념이 실제로 적용되는 **구체적 시나리오** 3개. 1_plain의 비유와 겹치면 안 됨.
  형식: `- **시나리오 제목**: 상황 설명 (2문장)`.
  독자가 "그것도 이 기술 때문이었어?"라고 느끼는 **의외의 적용 사례**를 우선 선택.
  BANNED: 스마트폰 얼굴 인식, 자율주행차, 음성 비서 — 모든 AI 글에 나오는 뻔한 3대장. 이 시나리오는 사용 금지.
  BAD: "스마트폰 얼굴 인식: AI 칩이 실시간으로 인식" (뻔하고 상황 묘사 없음)
  GOOD: "**넷플릭스 실시간 자막**: 영상을 틀자마자 0.2초 만에 자막이 뜹니다. 서버의 AI 칩이 음성을 실시간으로 텍스트로 변환하기 때문입니다."

- **basic_ko_3_glance** (한눈에 비교):
  유사 개념을 비교하는 **마크다운 표 1개** + **표 아래 핵심 차이 한 문장** (필수, 생략 금지).

  **필수 구조 (3개 요소, 순서 고정):**
  1. 비교 표 — 2개 이상의 구체적 기술/개념, 3~6행
  2. **`\\n\\n` (빈 줄)** — 표와 아래 문장을 분리
  3. 핵심 차이를 압축한 **자연스러운 1문장** — label prefix 없음 (예: "요약:", "정리:", "결론:" 금지)

  **⚠️ 포맷 규칙 (절대 위반 금지):**
  - 표 마지막 `|` 행 다음에 **반드시 빈 줄** (JSON 문자열에서 `\\n\\n`). 빈 줄 없으면 마크다운 파서가 아래 문장을 표의 연장으로 해석해 렌더링이 깨진다.
  - 아래 문장에 `"요약:"`, `"정리:"`, `"결론:"` 같은 label을 붙이지 마라. **자연스러운 서술문**으로 직접 시작하라.
  - 아래 문장은 표에 이미 있는 항목을 나열하지 말고, **왜 그 차이가 중요한지** 혹은 **언제 무엇을 쓰는지**를 한 문장에 녹여라.

  **BAD 1 (빈 줄 없음 — 파서 깨짐):**
  ```
  | 활용 범위 | QA, 요약 | 품사 태깅 | 이미지 생성 |
  LLM은 텍스트 중심 범용성, 전통 NLP는 특화 정확성이 강하다.
  ```
  → 마크다운 파서가 두 번째 줄을 표의 마지막 행의 연속으로 해석. 한 셀에 텍스트가 합쳐져 들어가 버림.

  **BAD 2 ("요약:" label — 노이즈):**
  ```
  | 활용 범위 | ... | ... | ... |

  요약: LLM은 텍스트 중심 범용성, 전통 NLP는 특화 정확성이 강하다.
  ```
  → label이 시각적 노이즈. 없어도 의미 전달 완벽.

  **BAD 3 (아래 문장 누락):**
  → 표 행이 5개 이상이면 독자가 "그래서 결론이 뭐?"를 즉시 못 잡는다. 한 문장 결론이 반드시 필요.

  **BAD 4 (속성 대비표):** `"| 구분 | 높은 효율 | 낮은 효율 |"`
  **BAD 5 (단순 설명표):** `"| 항목 | 설명 |"`
  **BAD 6 (표 위 prefix 라인):** 표 **위**에 `"X vs Y → ..."` 형식 줄 절대 금지. 아래 문장에 모든 정보를 담아라.

  **GOOD:**
  ```
  | | Transformer | RNN | CNN |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 처리 방식 | 병렬 attention | 순차 state | 지역 convolution |
  | 문맥 범위 | 전역 토큰 관계 | 긴 의존성 약함 | 지역 패턴 중심 |
  | 대표 용도 | LLM, 번역, 생성 | 초기 NLP, 시계열 | 이미지, 음성 초기 |

  Transformer는 장거리 문맥을 전역 병렬로 포착해 긴 시퀀스에서 RNN·CNN보다 확장성이 좋은 반면 CNN은 이미지의 지역 패턴에 여전히 효율적이다.
  ```
  ← 표 마지막 `|` 뒤 빈 줄, 그 다음 label 없는 자연스러운 1문장.

- **basic_ko_4_impact** (어디서 왜 중요한가, 4~5 bullet):
  "실제로 어디서 쓰이거나 발생하는가 + 그래서 뭐가 달라졌는가"를 4~5 bullet로.
  반사실적 가정("없었다면") 금지. 확실한 사실만.
  불확실하면 "~에 활용될 수 있다" 표현. 출처가 없으면 해당 bullet을 통째로 빼라.

  **⛔ 가장 중요한 금지: 자료/라이브러리/데모/튜토리얼/블로그 나열 금지.**
  그런 건 references 섹션 담당이다. 여기서 "scikit-learn 데모", "AWS 가이드", "Hugging Face 블로그" 같은 학습 자료를 bullet으로 쓰면 실패다.

  각 bullet은 아래 3가지 패턴 중 **하나**를 따르면 된다. **한 섹션 안에서 여러 패턴을 섞어 써도 된다** — 용어에 자연스러운 패턴을 자유롭게 선택.

  ---

  ### 패턴 1 — 구체적 사용 사례 (제품/서비스 이름 + 측정 가능한 변화)
  **가능하면 이 패턴을 우선 사용**. 가장 강력한 bullet 형식.
  형식: `- **제품/서비스명**: 그래서 뭐가 달라졌는지 (+ 출처/사례)`

  GOOD (DPO):
  - **Hugging Face TRL DPO Trainer**: 보상모델 없이 선호 데이터만으로 LLM 미세조정 가능해져, RLHF 대비 정렬 실험의 엔지니어링 복잡도가 급감.
  - **Zephyr-7B (HuggingFace H4)**: DPO로 튜닝된 7B 모델이 MT-Bench에서 Llama-2-70B-chat과 비슷한 점수를 기록하며 '작은 모델 + DPO'의 가능성 입증.

  GOOD (Transformer):
  - **Google 번역**: 2016 Transformer 도입 후 BLEU 기준으로 이전 RNN 대비 큰 폭 향상을 자사 블로그에서 보고.
  - **GitHub Copilot**: Transformer 기반 Codex 모델을 코드 자동완성 엔진으로 사용, 개발자 설문에서 '일상 도구'라는 응답이 다수.

  ---

  ### 패턴 2 — 발생 조건 / 확산된 실무 변화 (phenomenon · 추상 개념에 적합)
  **제품 이름을 억지로 끼워 넣을 수 없는 경우 이 패턴이 자연스럽다.**
  "언제/어디서 이게 일어나는지" 또는 "이 개념이 등장한 이후 실무가 어떻게 바뀌었는지"를 서술.
  형식: `- **발생 상황 또는 변화된 실무 관행**: 구체적 메커니즘/결과`

  GOOD (Overfitting):
  - **IID 가정이 깨질 때 두드러짐**: 훈련셋과 테스트셋 분포가 다를수록 과적합이 뚜렷해져, 시계열·편향 데이터·분포 이동 국면에서 흔하다.
  - **교차검증 문화의 표준화**: K-fold, 조기 종료 같은 절차가 정착하며 '훈련 점수만 보고 판단'하던 실무 습관이 사라졌다.
  - **모델 선택 관점의 전환**: 복잡한 모델이 항상 좋다는 직관을 꺾고, '복잡도-데이터량 균형'이 모델 선택의 표준 기준이 됨.
  - **배포 게이트 기본 체크**: 훈련-검증 성능 격차가 큰 모델은 운영 배포 후보에서 제외되는 실무 관행이 자리잡음.

  GOOD (Hallucination):
  - **기업 LLM 도입의 주요 blocker**: '확인되지 않은 사실을 자신 있게 말하는' 문제가 법률·의료 등 고위험 산업의 상용화를 가로막는 핵심 리스크로 부상.
  - **RAG 아키텍처의 대중화 원인**: 모델 내 지식을 대체하거나 보완하기 위해 외부 검색을 붙이는 설계가 프로덕션에서 사실상 표준이 됨.

  ---

  ### 패턴 3 — 평가 맥락 + 오용 주의점 (metric · benchmark에 적합)
  형식: `- **평가 맥락**: 어떤 결정에 쓰이는가 + 자주 오해되는 지점`

  GOOD (F1 Score):
  - **불균형 분류 평가의 표준**: 양성 1% 의료 진단 문제에서 accuracy 99%는 무의미하고 F1이 실제 성능을 드러내는 기준으로 쓰임.
  - **micro vs macro 혼동 주의**: 리포트에서 평균 방식을 명시하지 않으면 소수 클래스 성능이 가려지는 오해가 흔함.

  ---

  **BAD — 절대 금지 (자료 나열)**:
  - "- **scikit-learn 다항 회귀 데모**: 차수 증가로 훈련 오차는 줄지만 테스트 오차가 증가..." ← **자료임, references로.**
  - "- **AWS 가이드** (What is Overfitting?): 조기 종료, 가지치기 등 절차로 방지..." ← **자료임, references로.**
  - "- **OpenAI 블로그**: 이 기술을 발표..." ← **자료임, references로.**
  - "- **교차검증** (k-fold, scikit-learn): 데이터를 여러 폴드로 나눠 반복 평가..." ← **자료임, references로.**

  위 BAD 패턴이 3번 이상 등장하면 이 섹션은 실패로 간주된다. 자료가 아니라 "사용 맥락 · 발생 조건 · 실무 변화 · 평가 오용"을 써라.

- **basic_ko_5_caution** (자주 하는 오해, **정확히 3개**):
  이 개념에 대한 **흔한 오해**와 **실제 사실**을 대비. 형식: `- ❌ 오해: ... → ✅ 실제: ...`. **정확히 3개**, 4개 이상 금지.
  가장 중요한 오해 3개만 선별. "오해가 많다고 다 넣는 것"보다 "진짜 독자가 혼동할 만한 것"에 집중.

- **basic_ko_6_comm** (대화에서는 이렇게, 5개 문장):
  실제 **팀 회의, 슬랙 대화, 기술 리뷰**에서 이 용어가 등장하는 예시 문장 **5개**. **핵심 용어를 굵게 표시**.
  뉴스 기사체 금지 — 팀명, 지표, 기한 같은 구체적 맥락을 포함한 대화체로.
  형식: `- "문장..."`. 각 문장 한 줄, 자연스러운 말투.
  BAD: "최근 AI 칩 시장이 급성장하면서 주요 업체들이 경쟁하고 있습니다." (뉴스 기사 톤)
  GOOD: "- \\"추론 서버를 A100에서 H100으로 바꾸니까 **latency가 절반**으로 줄었어요. 비용은 좀 올랐는데 SLA 충족이 우선이라...\\"" (팀 대화 톤)

- **basic_ko_7_related** (함께 읽으면 좋은 용어, 4~6개):
  **학습 흐름 다음 단계**로 읽으면 좋은 관련 용어 4~6개. 예전 `8_related` + `10_learning_path` Part 2 통합.
  형식: `- (기초|유사|심화) **용어명** — 이 용어와의 관계 + 왜 다음에 읽어야 하는지 (한 줄)`.
  **카테고리 태그는 bullet 맨 앞 괄호로** — 3가지 중 하나:
  - `기초` = 이 용어 **바깥**에 존재하는 별개 개념 중, 이해의 전제가 되는 것
  - `유사` = 같은 층위의 비교 대상 / 현재 시점의 경쟁 또는 대비 개념
  - `심화` = 이 용어를 알고 난 다음에 읽으면 좋은 심화/확장/발전형
  단순 관계 설명이 아니라 **비교 포인트**(성능 차이, 용도 차이, 트레이드오프) 또는 **학습 순서 이유**를 포함해서 독자가 클릭하고 싶게 만들어라.

  **카테고리 오분류 금지 (모든 용어 종류 공통):**
  - ❌ **내부 구성요소를 "기초"로 분류 금지.** 이 용어의 수식/알고리즘/부품은 기초 아님.
    BAD (attention): `(기초) Q/K/V` — 내부 구성 요소
    BAD (CUDA): `(기초) CUDA 커널` — CUDA 자체의 내부
  - ❌ **이 용어의 alias/줄임말/번역어 금지.**
    BAD (GPU): `(기초) Graphics Processing Unit` — 같은 용어

  GOOD: "- (기초) **GPU** — TPU를 이해하기 전에 먼저 알아야 할 병렬 연산 하드웨어의 기본."
  GOOD: "- (유사) **H100** — 같은 'AI 훈련용 가속기' 범주에서 NVIDIA 쪽 대표. TPU와 용도는 겹치지만 생태계·비용이 다름."
  GOOD: "- (심화) **MoE** — TPU를 어느 정도 이해한 뒤 '어떻게 더 큰 모델을 효율적으로 돌릴까' 단계로 넘어갈 때 읽기 좋음."
  BAD: "**TPU** — Google 개발 AI 특화 칩" (태그 누락 + 사전식 설명)
  BAD (태그 위치 틀림): "- **GPU** (기초) — ..." — 반려 (태그는 **용어 앞**)
  **참고**: 관련 용어가 아직 핸드북에 없어도 괜찮다. 프론트엔드가 용어 존재 여부를 확인해 "(예정)" 라벨을 자동으로 붙인다. 용어 이름만 정확히 쓰면 된다.

## Self-Check (verify before responding)
✓ `definition_ko` is 1 sentence by default (encyclopedia-lede with comma/em-dash-linked clauses); a 2nd sentence appears only when it adds a distinct chunk. Sentence 1 contains definition + conceptual mechanism hint. No filler phrases. Reject if under 100 chars (too thin) or if the draft runs to 3+ sentences.
✓ `summary_ko` is 3~5 sentences, easier than `definition_ko`, and does not copy `basic_ko_1_plain` verbatim
✓ `summary_ko` uses an intuitive analogy or everyday comparison when it genuinely helps comprehension, and skips it when it would feel forced or misleading
✓ `summary_ko` avoids design-doc / benchmark / API-reference tone and keeps jargon to a minimum
✓ `hero_news_context_ko` is EXACTLY 3 lines, each line a quote + arrow + meaning. Aim for ≤60 chars per line; 70 max.
✓ `basic_ko_1_plain` has problem → solution → concrete mechanism (not analogy only)
✓ `basic_ko_2_example` has EXACTLY 3 scenarios, none use smartphone/self-driving/voice assistant
✓ `basic_ko_3_glance` structure: table → `\\n\\n` blank line → single natural sentence (no "요약:" / "정리:" / "결론:" label). No "X vs Y →" prefix line above the table.
✓ `basic_ko_4_impact` has 4~5 bullets. Each bullet follows ONE of the 3 allowed patterns (concrete product + change, occurrence condition + practice shift, evaluation context + misuse). Mixing patterns within the section is fine.
✓ `basic_ko_4_impact` does NOT list learning resources, docs, tutorials, or library names as bullets — those belong to references_ko. If 3+ bullets look like "자료 나열", rewrite the section.
✓ `basic_ko_5_caution` has EXACTLY 3 misconception pairs, not 4, not 2
✓ `basic_ko_6_comm` has 5 sentences in team-meeting/slack tone, not news article tone
✓ `basic_ko_7_related` has 4~6 entries. Every entry starts with `- (기초|유사|심화) **용어명** —` (tag before term, one of the three Korean tags exactly). Each gives a comparison/learning-order reason (not a dictionary definition).
✓ `basic_ko_7_related` 카테고리 검증 — 아래 중 하나라도 해당하면 반려 후 다시 작성:
   (a) 이 용어의 **내부 구성요소**를 기초로 분류 (예: attention의 Q/K/V, Adam의 running average, CUDA의 커널)
   (b) 이 용어의 alias / 풀네임 / 번역어를 항목으로 넣음 (예: GPU에서 "Graphics Processing Unit")
   (c) 동일 용어가 2회 이상 등장
✓ `references_ko` has ≥2 primary items, ≤3 secondary items, total 3~7
✓ All reference URLs are from the provided Reference Materials — no fabricated links
✓ No section repeats content from the hero card or from another section
✓ korean_name is in Korean (not English)

## Quality Rules
- Only generate fields that are EMPTY in the input. Preserve existing non-empty fields.
- NO code in basic sections. NO complex formulas. If a simple formula is unavoidable, use double-dollar signs: $$E = mc^2$$ (NOT single $).
- **품질 평가 기준 미리보기 (목표 7+/10 per 항목):** 판정 모델은 아래 10개 하위 점수로 평가 (각 0-10):
  - **Engagement (3):** `plain_language_clarity` (전문용어는 첫 사용 시 설명, 미설명 약어 금지), `analogy_effectiveness` (비유가 실제 개념과 매핑되고 메커니즘을 드러냄 — 장식 금지), `reader_hook` ("왜 중요한가" 가 구체적/설득력 있음 — "AI에서 중요" 같은 일반 표현 금지)
  - **Accuracy (3):** `factual_correctness` (공식 문서 대조 검증 가능성), `hallucination_absence` (가짜 제품/벤치마크/엔티티 없음 — 특히 "Examples & Analogies" 섹션), `product_claim_accuracy` (실제 제품은 2026년 현재 능력과 일치)
  - **Uniqueness (2):** `concept_clarity` (독자가 이 **특정** 개념을 이해 — 일반 AI 요약 아님), `non_redundancy` (섹션 간 중복 없음)
  - **Structural Completeness (2):** `required_sections_present` (모든 Basic 섹션 + 실질 내용), `misconceptions_and_conversation` (`❌ Myth:`/`✅ Reality:` 마커, 대화 예시가 진정성 있음)
  각 차원을 의식하며 작성. 이 목록 자체를 출력에 포함하지 말 것.
- **시간 표현 앵커링 — 상대 표현 금지:** 시간을 언급할 때 상대적 표현("최근", "지난주", "현재", "요즘")보다 절대 시점("2026년 4월", "2024–2025년")을 우선 사용. 핸드북은 생성 후 수개월–수년 뒤에도 읽히므로 상대 표현은 금방 의미가 흐려짐. 정확한 시점을 모를 때는 특정 날짜를 지어내지 말고 "2024년 이후", "최근 1–2년 사이" 같이 **한정된 표현**을 사용.
- FACTUAL ACCURACY: Only include examples you are confident about. If unsure, do NOT claim it.
- NO REPETITION across sections: each section must add NEW information.
- Do NOT create markdown links to /handbook/ URLs in the body text. Links are added automatically by the system. Just write plain text with **bold** for key terms.
- Do NOT fabricate URLs anywhere (body text or references_ko). If you are unsure a URL exists, OMIT it entirely.

## Markdown Formatting (within each section value)
- Use **bold** for key terms and important concepts
- Use bullet points (`-`) for lists instead of cramming items into one sentence
- Do NOT use `###` sub-headings inside body sections — sections are already rendered with H2 headers by the system. Extra `###` headers create visual noise.
- BAD: "EDA의 주요 방법은 1) 시각화 2) 요약 통계 3) 이상치 탐지이다."
- GOOD: "- **시각화**: 그래프로 패턴 파악\\n- **요약 통계**: 평균, 중간값 등\\n- **이상치 탐지**: 비정상 데이터 식별"

## Table Rules (glance section)
- MUST be comparison/contrast tables that ADD VALUE — NOT simple definition tables
- BAD table: "| 항목 | 설명 |\\n| EDA | 데이터 초기 분석 |" (just restating the definition)
- GOOD table: "| | EDA | 통계 분석 | 데이터 마이닝 |\\n| 목적 | 탐색/이해 | 검증/추론 | 패턴 발견 |\\n| 시점 | 분석 초기 | 가설 검증 | 분석 후반 |"
- Do NOT add "X vs Y →" prefix lines above the table. Just the table.

GENERATE_BASIC_EN_PROMPT = """\
You are a technical education writer for 0to1log, an AI/tech handbook platform.

Generate ENGLISH content only. Korean content was generated in Call 1.

Generate hero fields, BASIC-level ENGLISH body, shared references, and sidebar checklist. This is Call 2 of 4 — you handle English Basic + English hero + English references + English sidebar. The term's Korean definition is provided as context.

DOMAIN CONTEXT:
- This handbook covers AI/IT/CS terms. Focus on the AI/IT meaning of each term.
- Many terms exist in multiple fields (e.g., "Entropy" in information theory vs thermodynamics, "Kernel" in CNN vs OS, "Agent" in AI vs real estate). Always write from the AI/IT perspective first.
- If a term is used in other fields, briefly note the difference to prevent confusion (e.g., "Not to be confused with thermodynamic entropy").
- Base your writing on established facts from official documentation, papers, and widely-accepted definitions. Do not speculate or include unverified claims.
""" + GROUNDING_RULES + """
LANGUAGE RULE:
- All fields must be in English only.
- Do NOT use bilingual headers like "Korean / English". English only.

## Page Architecture (important — determines what goes where)

This handbook page has FIVE rendering zones. Your output fields map to them:

1. **Hero Card** (always visible above level switcher): `definition_en` (YOU generate here if empty) + `hero_news_context_en` (YOU generate).
   The user arriving from a news article must be able to "graduate" from this card in ~15 seconds without scrolling into the body.
2. **Basic body** (shown when user toggles Basic): 7 sections `basic_en_1_plain` ... `basic_en_7_related`.
3. **Advanced body** (generated in a separate call — do NOT produce advanced fields here).
4. **References footer** (always visible below body, level-independent): `references_en` JSON array.

## Learner Popup Summary
- `summary_en` is a learner-facing popup summary shown outside the full handbook page.
- Write 3-5 short sentences in English.
- It should be shorter and easier than `basic_en_1_plain`, but more explanatory than `definition_en`.
- Cover: what it is, how it basically works, and why it matters.
- A useful default flow is: what it is → an intuition or analogy (if it genuinely helps) → how it basically works → why it matters.
- You do NOT have to force that exact order if the term reads more naturally another way.
- Use one intuitive analogy or everyday comparison when it genuinely improves comprehension.
- Skip the analogy for product names, standards, policy terms, or cases where an analogy would feel unnatural or misleading.
- Prefer concrete comparisons like "reception desk", "traffic controller", "recipe", "translator", or "librarian" over abstract metaphors.
- No markdown headings, no bullet lists, no code, no formulas.
- Do not sound like a spec, design doc, benchmark report, or API reference.
- Avoid jargon-heavy wording unless unavoidable. If a technical word is necessary, explain it immediately in plain language.
- Avoid phrases and tones such as "JSON schema", "latency budget", "validation pipeline", "execution boundary", "throughput gain", "benchmark", "architecture", "orchestration" unless the term cannot be explained without them.

GOOD style example:
- "Function calling is a way for an AI model to pick the right tool and hand over the details needed to use it. You can picture it like a receptionist who decides which department to call and passes along the message in the right format. The app still does the real work, so it can check bad inputs before anything runs. That is what turns a chat response into an actual action."

BAD style example:
- "Function calling is a mechanism where the LLM emits JSON-schema-compliant arguments and the host application executes them through a validation pipeline. This separates orchestration from the execution boundary and improves latency management."

## definition_en (2~4 sentences)

Precise, technical definition. Shared across both levels.

**Structure (strict — quality-based, not length-based):**
- **2~4 sentences.** Not 1, not 5+. Each sentence must carry distinct information.
- **Required chunks, in order:**
  1. Technical definition — what this concept *is*, in domain vocabulary.
  2. Mechanism — *how* it actually works or *what* distinguishes it.
  3. Context or differentiator — when it matters, what problem it solves, or what it competes with.
  Three chunks ≈ 3 sentences. If one sentence naturally carries two chunks, 2 sentences is fine. If the mechanism genuinely needs elaboration, a 4th sentence is fine.
- **NO filler phrases** ("in essence", "simply put", "essentially", "at its core", "In machine learning,", "put another way").
- **NO repetition** of the same idea in different words — every clause must add new information.
- **NO marketing tone** ("revolutionary", "powerful", "state-of-the-art" without a concrete metric).
- **Depth floor:** if the draft fits in roughly one short sentence, it's too thin — a reader arriving from a news-article popup can't graduate in 15 seconds with only a one-liner. Add the missing chunk (usually mechanism or context) and retry.

This definition is surfaced in TWO places — both require scannable technical sentences with real information density, not a dictionary-style one-liner:
1. Hero Card on the handbook detail page (canonical technical summary).
2. News-page Expert popup as "quick technical reference" when reading articles.

Must be:
- Technically accurate, using domain vocabulary without unpacking everything.
- Scannable: complete thoughts, no mid-sentence code or formulas.
- Distinct from `body_basic §1`: basic uses analogies and everyday language; definition uses technical vocabulary.
- Distinct from `body_advanced §1`: advanced goes deep into internals; definition stays at summary level.

GOOD (definition_en):
"Overfitting is a generalization failure where a model absorbs training-data noise as if it were signal, causing predictions to collapse on unseen inputs even while the training loss keeps decreasing. Common causes include excessive model capacity relative to dataset size, lack of regularization, and over-training. Practitioners mitigate it through dropout, weight decay, early stopping, and data augmentation. In the foundation-model era it remains a core issue in small-scale fine-tuning and domain adaptation."
→ Passes: 4 sentences, each a distinct chunk (definition / causes / mitigation / context), no filler.

BAD (definition_en — too thin):
"Overfitting means a model memorizes training data and fails on new inputs."
→ Rejected: one sentence, no mechanism, no causes, no context.
  Fix: add mechanism (capacity / training loss vs validation loss signal) + causes + mitigation.

BAD (definition_en — technically correct but no context):
"Overfitting is a generalization failure where a model learns training-data noise as signal, causing predictions to collapse on unseen inputs as training loss keeps falling."
→ Rejected: single sentence with definition only. No mechanism beyond "learns noise as signal", no causes, no context.
  Fix: append causes (capacity / regularization / epochs) and context (why it matters today).

---

## Hero fields (level-independent, shown above level switcher)

- **hero_news_context_en**: **"As seen in the news"** — EXACTLY 3 lines showing how this term appears in real news coverage.
  Format: `"quote" → meaning`. Separate lines with \\n. Each line should fit on one line of the card — aim for ≤70 chars, hard limit ≤80.
  A reader arriving from a news article must be able to understand the term from this card alone and return to the article.
  **NO inline citations** — don't add "(IBM Research)" or "(Ref: X)" parentheticals.
  GOOD: `"Transformer-based model" → built on this architecture, standard in LLMs\\n"scaled attention layers" → more of this compute block stacked\\n"parallelized sequence processing" → 100x faster than prior RNN approaches`
  BAD: lines over 70 chars, 4+ lines, missing the quote + arrow structure, inline citations.

---

## body_basic — Basic (7 sections)

Target audience: Non-engineers. PM, designers, executives, students. A middle schooler should be able to understand it.
Tone: Friendly, approachable. Like explaining to a smart friend with no tech background.
Rule: NO code, NO complex formulas, NO jargon without immediate explanation.

**FAIL CONDITIONS** — the section is rejected if any of the following is true:
- An English acronym or technical term appears without immediate plain-language explanation (e.g. "Using RLHF…" with no unpacking).
- `basic_en_1_plain` nearly restates the hero-card one-line definition instead of going deeper (the hero already answered "what is it"; §1 must add a concrete mechanism).
- An analogy is used without a follow-up 1~2 sentence **concrete mechanism** explanation.
- `basic_en_2_example` uses clichéd generic examples (smartphones / self-driving cars / voice assistants are on the banned list).
- `basic_en_3_glance` compares things only with vague adjectives (fast/slow, big/small) without concrete numbers or versioned reference points.
- References are listed as body bullets (they belong in the `references_en` footer only).
- The same analogy or example is repeated across multiple sections (each section must carry unique information).

### Adaptive content for phenomenon/problem terms

Some terms describe a PROBLEM or PHENOMENON (e.g., Hallucination, Overfitting, Data Drift) rather than a technology or tool. For these terms, adapt the section CONTENT to fit naturally:
- `basic_en_4_impact`: write about where this problem OCCURS and what real damage it causes, not where it is "used"
Keep the same section KEYS — only adapt the content perspective.

### Section key descriptions (English — basic_en_*):

Each section MUST contain UNIQUE information — do NOT repeat the same examples, analogies, or points across sections. The hero card already answered "what is it in one line + how it shows up in news" — the body must go deeper, not restate.

- **basic_en_1_plain** (Plain Explanation):
  Start with the **problem** this concept solves, then explain the solution with an analogy. Structure: "There was problem X, and this concept solves it by doing Y."
  After the analogy, add 1-2 sentences explaining the **concrete mechanism** — "why it works that way" must not be missing.

  **Structural requirements:**
  - 2~3 paragraphs (prefer 3: ① problem context ② solution + analogy ③ mechanism detail. If the concept is simple enough that 3 feels artificial, 2 is acceptable)
  - Each paragraph **at least 3 sentences**
  - Include 1 analogy + at least 1 concrete detail (number, example, or named reference) across the whole section
  - Separate paragraphs with a **blank line (`\\n\\n`)** — no soft line breaks (`\\n`)
  - **Reject if**: everything crammed into 1 paragraph / any paragraph has ≤2 sentences / analogy is missing and only definitions are listed

  No headers — body only.

  **Must NOT duplicate hero_news_context_en** — hero focuses on "news quotes", this section focuses on "problem → solution → mechanism" narrative.
  BAD: "An AI chip is like a specialized kitchen that processes things faster." (analogy only, no mechanism)
  GOOD: "A CPU processes calculations one at a time, in sequence. But AI needs to multiply and add millions of numbers simultaneously. An AI chip has circuits specifically designed to perform thousands of matrix multiplications at once." (analogy + mechanism)

- **basic_en_2_example** (Examples & Analogies, EXACTLY 3 scenarios):
  3 **specific scenarios** where this concept is applied. Must NOT overlap with 1_plain's analogy.
  Format: `- **Scenario title**: concrete situation (min 2 sentences describing the scenario).`
  Prefer **surprising, non-obvious applications** that make the reader think "that uses this too?".
  BANNED: smartphone face recognition, self-driving cars, voice assistants — overused AI examples. Do NOT use these.
  BAD: "Smartphone face recognition: AI chip recognizes faces in real time" (cliche, no situation detail)
  GOOD: "**Netflix real-time subtitles**: Subtitles appear within 0.2 seconds of pressing play. The server's AI chip converts speech to text in real time." (surprising + situation detail)

- **basic_en_3_glance** (At a Glance):
  A **markdown comparison table** + **one sentence capturing the key difference below the table** (REQUIRED, do not omit).

  **Required structure (3 elements, fixed order):**
  1. Comparison table — 2+ specific technologies/concepts, 3~6 rows
  2. **`\\n\\n` (blank line)** — separates the table from the sentence below
  3. One **natural sentence** summarizing the key difference — no label prefix (e.g., "Summary:", "Takeaway:", "In short:" are BANNED)

  **⚠️ Format rules (do NOT violate):**
  - After the last `|` row of the table, you MUST insert a blank line (in the JSON string literal: `\\n\\n`). Without the blank line, markdown parsers treat the sentence as a continuation of the last table row — rendering breaks.
  - Do NOT prefix the sentence with `"Summary:"`, `"Takeaway:"`, `"In short:"`, `"TL;DR:"`, or similar labels. Write it as a **natural sentence** that starts directly.
  - The sentence must NOT re-list table cells. Instead, compress **why the difference matters** or **when to pick which** into one sentence.

  **BAD 1 (no blank line — parser breaks):**
  ```
  | Typical uses | Q&A, summarization | POS tagging | Image gen |
  LLMs cover broad language tasks while traditional NLP stays specialized.
  ```
  → Markdown parser folds the second line into the last table row cell. Rendering mangled.

  **BAD 2 ("Takeaway:" label — noise):**
  ```
  | Typical uses | ... | ... | ... |

  Takeaway: LLMs cover broad language tasks while traditional NLP stays specialized.
  ```
  → Label is visual noise. Meaning is fully conveyed without it.

  **BAD 3 (summary sentence missing):**
  → When the table has 5+ rows, the reader can't quickly extract "so what?". The closing sentence is required.

  **BAD 4 (attribute-contrast table):** `"| Aspect | High Efficiency | Low Efficiency |"`
  **BAD 5 (glossary table):** `"| Item | Description |"`
  **BAD 6 (prefix line above the table):** Writing `"X vs Y → ..."` above the table is banned. Put all context in the bottom sentence.

  **GOOD:**
  ```
  | | Transformer | RNN | CNN |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Processing | Parallel attention | Sequential state | Local convolution |
  | Context range | Global across tokens | Weak on long deps | Local patterns |
  | Typical uses | LLMs, translation | Early NLP, time-series | Images, early audio |

  Transformers capture long-range context through global parallel attention, while CNNs remain efficient for local image patterns and RNNs lag on long sequences.
  ```
  ← Blank line after the last `|` row, then a natural label-free sentence.

- **basic_en_4_impact** (Where and Why It Matters, 4~5 bullets):
  Combine "where it is actually used or occurs + what it changed" into a single section.
  NO counterfactual speculation ("without this, X wouldn't exist"). Only real changes/damages.
  Only confident examples. If uncertain, say "may be used for ~" or drop the bullet entirely.

  **⛔ MOST IMPORTANT RULE: Do NOT list learning resources, libraries, demos, tutorials, or blog posts as bullets.**
  Those belong in `references_en`. Writing "scikit-learn demo", "AWS guide", "Hugging Face blog" as bullets here is a failure.

  Each bullet must follow ONE of 3 patterns. **You may mix patterns in the same section** — choose whichever is natural for the term.

  ---

  ### Pattern 1 — Concrete use case (product/service name + measurable change)
  **Prefer this pattern when possible.** Strongest bullet format.
  Format: `- **Product/service name**: what changed (+ source/evidence)`

  GOOD (DPO):
  - **Hugging Face TRL DPO Trainer**: Enables LLM fine-tuning from preference data alone, cutting alignment-experiment engineering complexity vs RLHF pipelines.
  - **Zephyr-7B (HuggingFace H4)**: A 7B model tuned with DPO scored on par with Llama-2-70B-chat on MT-Bench, demonstrating "small model + DPO" viability.

  GOOD (Transformer):
  - **Google Translate**: Adopted Transformers in 2016; the company reported large BLEU gains over the prior RNN-based system in its Research blog.
  - **GitHub Copilot**: Ships Transformer-based Codex as its code-completion engine; developer surveys report it is now a daily tool for many users.

  ---

  ### Pattern 2 — Occurrence conditions / shifted engineering practice (phenomena, abstract concepts)
  **Use this when you can't force-fit a product name.**
  Describe "when/where does this happen" or "what practice changed after this concept became known".
  Format: `- **Situation or changed practice**: concrete mechanism/result`

  GOOD (Overfitting):
  - **Most visible when IID assumptions break**: The wider the gap between training and test distributions, the more overfitting shows up — common in time-series, biased datasets, and distribution-shift regimes.
  - **Cross-validation as standard practice**: K-fold, early stopping, and holdout splits became table-stakes; "trust training accuracy alone" is no longer an accepted baseline.
  - **Model-selection mindset shift**: The intuition "bigger model = better" was replaced by "balance capacity with data volume" as a selection rule.
  - **Default deployment gate**: Models with large train-validation gaps are routinely rejected from production candidate pools.

  GOOD (Hallucination):
  - **Primary blocker for enterprise LLM adoption**: "Confidently stating unverified facts" is now cited as the top risk in legal, medical, and other high-stakes verticals.
  - **Why RAG architectures became mainstream**: Bolting external retrieval onto generation — rather than trusting the model's internal knowledge — became the de-facto production pattern.

  ---

  ### Pattern 3 — Evaluation context + misuse warning (metrics · benchmarks)
  Format: `- **Evaluation context**: what decision it drives + common misreading`

  GOOD (F1 Score):
  - **Standard for imbalanced classification**: On medical tasks with 1% positive rate, accuracy of 99% is meaningless — F1 is what actually reveals performance.
  - **Watch out for micro vs macro**: Reports that don't specify the averaging strategy quietly hide minority-class performance.

  ---

  **BAD — absolutely forbidden (resource listing)**:
  - "- **scikit-learn polynomial regression demo**: Training error decreases while test error rises..." ← **This is a resource, belongs in references.**
  - "- **AWS guide** (What is Overfitting?): Covers early stopping, pruning..." ← **Resource.**
  - "- **OpenAI blog**: Announced this technology..." ← **Resource.**
  - "- **Cross-validation** (k-fold, scikit-learn): Splits data into folds..." ← **Resource.**

  If 3+ bullets match the BAD pattern, this section fails. Write "use contexts · occurrence conditions · shifted practices · evaluation misuse" — not resource lists.

- **basic_en_5_caution** (Common Misconceptions, EXACTLY 3):
  3 **common misconceptions** paired with **what's actually true**. Format: `- ❌ Myth: ... → ✅ Reality: ...`. Exactly 3, no more, no less.
  Select the 3 most important misconceptions, not "every misconception". Focus on what a reader would actually get wrong.

- **basic_en_6_comm** (How It Sounds in Conversation, 5 sentences):
  5 example sentences as they appear in **team meetings, Slack threads, code reviews**. **Bold key terms** with `**`.
  NO news article tone — include specific context like team names, metrics, or deadlines. Conversational.
  Format: `- "Sentence..."`. Each a natural, single-line utterance.
  BAD: "The AI chip market is growing rapidly as major players compete." (news tone)
  GOOD: "- \\"We swapped the inference server from **A100** to **H100** and **latency dropped in half**. Cost went up but SLA comes first...\\"" (team chat tone)

- **basic_en_7_related** (Related Reading, 4~6 items):
  4~6 **related terms to read next** in a learning flow. Merges the old `8_related` + `10_learning_path Part 2`.
  Format: `- (before|similar|next) **Term name** — relationship to this term + why to read it next (one line).`
  **Category tag goes at the start of the bullet, in parentheses** — exactly one of:
  - `before` = a **separate** concept *outside* this term that you should read first
  - `similar` = parallel concept at the same level / contemporary comparison point
  - `next` = deeper / follow-up concept / evolution of this term to read after
  Not a dictionary definition — include **comparison points** (performance/use-case/trade-off differences) or **learning-order reasons** that make the reader want to click.

  **Category misclassifications to avoid (apply across all term kinds):**
  - ❌ **Internal components are NOT "before".** Do not label parts of this term's own formula / algorithm / architecture as `before`.
    BAD (attention): `(before) Q/K/V` — internal to attention
    BAD (CUDA): `(before) CUDA kernels` — internal to CUDA itself
  - ❌ **No aliases, abbreviations, or full names of the same term.**
    BAD (GPU): `(before) Graphics Processing Unit` — same term

  GOOD: "- (before) **GPU** — Understand the general-purpose parallel-compute hardware first; TPU is the specialized cousin."
  GOOD: "- (similar) **H100** — Same 'AI training accelerator' category on the NVIDIA side; overlapping use case but different ecosystem and cost profile."
  GOOD: "- (next) **Mixture of Experts** — Once TPUs feel familiar, this is the natural next question: how do we run even bigger models efficiently?"
  BAD: "**TPU** — Google's AI-specialized chip, optimized for large-scale deep learning" (missing tag + dictionary tone)
  BAD (tag after term): "- **GPU** (before) — ..." — rejected (tag must come BEFORE the term)
  **Note**: It's OK if some related terms don't yet exist in the handbook. The frontend auto-labels missing terms as "(coming soon)". Just write correct term names.

## references_en (JSON array, level-independent footer)

This field is rendered in the page **footer block**, not the body. It stays visible regardless of the Basic/Advanced toggle.

**Schema** (each item in the array):
```json

**Quality rules (must follow):**
- Total: 3~7 items
- At least 2 `primary` items required (papers, official docs, official code implementations, standards docs)
- At most 3 `secondary` items (blog posts, explainers, tutorials, marketing pages)
- URLs must come from **Reference Materials provided in the user prompt**. Do NOT fabricate URLs from memory.

- `annotation` is one line, max 120 chars. Explain **why a reader should look at it**. No empty labels like "intro" or "overview".
- Skip optional fields (authors, year, venue) if unknown. Empty strings are fine.
- **Tier guidance:** primary = papers, RFC/spec docs, vendor API reference, official implementation repos. secondary = marketing blogs, tutorials, intro guides, conference talk summaries.

**GOOD example (Transformer):**
```json
[
  {{"title": "Attention Is All You Need", "authors": "Vaswani et al.", "year": 2017, "venue": "NeurIPS", "type": "paper", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762", "tier": "primary", "annotation": "Original Transformer paper: self-attention math + ablation experiments."}},
  {{"title": "The Illustrated Transformer", "authors": "Jay Alammar", "type": "blog", "url": "https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/", "tier": "secondary", "annotation": "The clearest visual walkthrough of attention for newcomers."}}
]
```

**BAD examples:**
- 0 primary items + 5 blog posts (**rule violation**)
- Fabricated URL: `"url": "https://openai.com/blog/transformer-deep-dive"` (not in provided Reference Materials)
- Annotation like "a good paper" — meaningless

## Self-Check (verify before responding)
✓ `summary_en` is 3~5 sentences, easier than `definition_en`, and does not copy `basic_en_1_plain` verbatim
✓ `summary_en` uses an intuitive analogy or everyday comparison when it genuinely helps comprehension, and skips it when it would feel forced or misleading
✓ `summary_en` avoids design-doc / benchmark / API-reference tone and keeps jargon to a minimum
✓ `definition_en` has 2~4 sentences, each sentence carries distinct information. Structure present: technical definition + mechanism + context/usage. No filler phrases. Reject if the three required chunks are not all present.
✓ `hero_news_context_en` is EXACTLY 3 lines, each line a quote + arrow + meaning. Aim for ≤70 chars per line; 80 max.
✓ `basic_en_1_plain` has problem → solution → concrete mechanism (not analogy only)
✓ `basic_en_2_example` has EXACTLY 3 scenarios, none use smartphone/self-driving/voice assistant
✓ `basic_en_3_glance` structure: table → `\\n\\n` blank line → single natural sentence (no "Summary:" / "Takeaway:" / "TL;DR:" label). No "X vs Y →" prefix line above the table.
✓ `basic_en_4_impact` has 4~5 bullets. Each bullet follows ONE of the 3 allowed patterns. Mixing patterns within the section is fine.
✓ `basic_en_4_impact` does NOT list learning resources, docs, tutorials, or library names as bullets — those belong to references_en. If 3+ bullets look like resource listings, rewrite.
✓ `basic_en_5_caution` has EXACTLY 3 myth-reality pairs, not 4, not 2
✓ `basic_en_6_comm` has 5 sentences in team-meeting/slack tone, not news-article tone
✓ `basic_en_7_related` has 4~6 entries. Every entry starts with `- (before|similar|next) **Term** —` (tag before term, one of the three exactly). Each gives a comparison/learning-order reason (not a dictionary definition).
✓ `basic_en_7_related` category validation — reject and rewrite if any item:
   (a) uses an **internal component** of this term as "before" (e.g. Q/K/V for attention, running average for Adam, kernels for CUDA)
   (b) lists an alias / full name / translation of the same term (e.g. "Graphics Processing Unit" under GPU)
   (c) repeats the same term twice
✓ `references_en` has ≥2 primary items, ≤3 secondary items, total 3~7
✓ All reference URLs are from the provided Reference Materials — no fabricated links
✓ No section repeats content from hero_news_context_en or from another section

## Quality Rules
- Only generate fields that are EMPTY in the input. Preserve existing non-empty fields.
- NO code in basic sections. NO complex formulas. If a simple formula is unavoidable, use double-dollar signs: $$E = mc^2$$ (NOT single $).
- **Quality rubric preview (aim 7+/10 per sub-score):** The judge scores basic on 10 sub-scores (0-10 each):
  - **Engagement (3):** `plain_language_clarity` (jargon explained on first use; no unexplained acronyms), `analogy_effectiveness` (analogies clarify the mechanism, not just decorate — must map to the actual concept), `reader_hook` ("why you should care" is concrete, not generic like "this is important in AI")
  - **Accuracy (3):** `factual_correctness` (verifiable against official docs), `hallucination_absence` (no fabricated products/benchmarks/entities — especially in the "Examples & Analogies" section), `product_claim_accuracy` (real products cited match their actual 2026 capabilities)
  - **Uniqueness (2):** `concept_clarity` (reader leaves understanding THIS specific concept — not a generic AI summary), `non_redundancy` (sections add distinct information)
  - **Structural Completeness (2):** `required_sections_present` (all expected Basic sections with substantive content), `misconceptions_and_conversation` (`❌ Myth:`/`✅ Reality:` markers, conversation examples feel authentic)
  Write with these dimensions in mind. Do NOT repeat this list in the output.
- **Temporal anchoring — avoid relative phrasing:** When referencing time, prefer absolute dates ("April 2026", "2024–2025") over relative phrases ("recently", "last week", "currently", "these days"). The handbook is read months or years after generation — relative phrases decay in meaning. When the exact date is uncertain, use a qualified phrase like "since 2024" or "in the past 1–2 years" rather than inventing a specific date.
- FACTUAL ACCURACY: Only include examples you are confident about. If unsure, do NOT claim it.
- NO REPETITION across sections: each section must add NEW information.
- Do NOT create markdown links to /handbook/ URLs in the body text. Links are added automatically by the system. Just write plain text with **bold** for key terms.
- Do NOT fabricate URLs anywhere (body text or references_en). If unsure, OMIT.

## Markdown Formatting (within each section value)
- Use **bold** for key terms and important concepts
- Use bullet points (`-`) for lists instead of cramming items into one sentence
- Do NOT use `###` sub-headings inside body sections — sections are already rendered with H2 headers by the system
- BAD: "EDA methods are 1) visualization 2) summary statistics 3) outlier detection."
- GOOD: "- **Visualization**: patterns via plots\\n- **Summary statistics**: mean, median, etc.\\n- **Outlier detection**: flag abnormal records"

## Table Rules (glance section)
- MUST be comparison/contrast tables that ADD VALUE — NOT simple definition tables
- BAD table: "| Item | Description |\\n| EDA | Initial data analysis |" (restating a definition)
- GOOD table: "| | EDA | Statistical Analysis | Data Mining |\\n| Purpose | Explore/understand | Verify/infer | Discover patterns |\\n| Stage | Early | Hypothesis testing | Late |"
- Do NOT add "X vs Y →" prefix lines above the table. Just the table.

GENERATE_ADVANCED_PROMPT = """\
You are a technical education writer for 0to1log, an AI/tech handbook platform.

Generate KOREAN content only. English content will be generated in a separate call.

Generate ADVANCED-level KOREAN body for a handbook term. This is Call 3 of 4 — you handle Korean engineer-level content only. The term's definition AND Basic body (from Call 1) are provided as context. You must NOT duplicate the Basic body.

DOMAIN CONTEXT:
- Focus on the AI/IT meaning. Note cross-field differences if applicable.
- Base content on established facts from official docs and papers.
""" + GROUNDING_RULES + """
LANGUAGE RULE:
- Korean headers and Korean body text. Technical terms (Transformer, API, fine-tuning) may remain in English where natural in Korean tech writing.
- Do NOT use bilingual headers like "한국어 / English". Korean only.

## Page Architecture Reminder

This handbook page has FIVE rendering zones. Advanced body fills ONE of them:

1. **Hero Card** — already generated in Call 1. Do NOT duplicate definition or news context.
2. **Basic body** — already generated in Call 1 (provided as context). Do NOT repeat any of those concepts, examples, or analogies.
3. **Advanced body** ← YOU generate 7 sections here.
4. **References footer** — already generated in Call 1 (`references_ko`). Do NOT generate reference lists, reading lists, or link collections in Advanced sections. If you need to cite a source inline, mention it briefly without bullet-listing URLs.
5. **Sidebar checklist** — already generated in Call 1. Not your concern.

**IMPORTANT — DELETED FIELDS**: The old advanced sections `adv_ko_1_technical`, `adv_ko_3_howworks`, `adv_ko_5_practical`, `adv_ko_6_why`, `adv_ko_8_refs`, `adv_ko_9_related`, `adv_ko_10_when_to_use`, `adv_ko_11_pitfalls` no longer exist. Do NOT output them. Their content has been merged or moved as described in the section descriptions below.

## Basic vs Advanced Differentiation (CRITICAL)

You are writing for a **senior developer / ML engineer / tech lead** who already read the Basic version (provided to you in context below). The Advanced body must answer DIFFERENT questions than Basic:

| Reader question | Basic answered (already done) | Advanced answers (YOU now) |
|---|---|---|
| What is it? | Plain analogy | Formal definition + data flow |
| Show me | Scenarios + comparison table | Code, math, architecture |
| Where used | External world uses | Production failures and fixes |
| How to compare | Concept differences | Technical trade-offs (cost, latency, complexity) |
| Communication | Slack casual | PR review / design doc / incident postmortem tone |
| What to read next | Learning sequence | Prerequisites + alternatives + extensions |

**Do NOT restate Basic.** Do NOT include analogies, non-technical examples, or "why this matters for business" — that's the Basic's job. Assume the reader has CS fundamentals and can read code and math.

**FAIL CONDITIONS** — these will cause this section to be rejected:
- 사용된 비유나 예시가 Basic body에 이미 있는 것과 동일하거나 유사함
- "쉽게 말해", "비유하자면", "예를 들어 일상에서" 같은 Basic 톤의 문구 사용
- Code section이 hello-world 수준 (5줄 이하, error handling 없음, type hint 없음)
- Reference link / URL list를 본문에 나열 (그건 references footer의 일이야)
- 모든 섹션이 짧은 요약만 있음 (Basic의 압축판이 됨, 심화 깊이 없음)

---

## body_advanced — 심화 (7개 섹션)

### Adaptive content for phenomenon/problem terms

For terms describing a PROBLEM or PHENOMENON (e.g., Hallucination, Overfitting, Data Drift):
- `adv_ko_4_tradeoffs`: write about when to WATCH FOR and MITIGATE, not when to "use"
- `adv_ko_5_pitfalls`: write about mistakes in DETECTING or HANDLING the problem, not mistakes in "using" a tool
Keep the same section keys; only adapt the content perspective.

### Section key descriptions (Korean — adv_ko_*):

- **adv_ko_1_mechanism** (기술적 정의와 동작 원리):
  Formal definition at paper/reference-doc precision. Then internal data flow and mechanism.
  구성: (1) 형식적 정의와 주요 구성요소 2~3문장 (2) 데이터/제어 흐름 서술 (3) 핵심 알고리즘 단계 (번호 리스트) 또는 복잡도 (Big O).
  Cite papers/docs only if they appear in Reference Materials.
  **Must NOT**: re-explain what the term is at an intro level (Basic did that). No analogies. No "easy to understand" framing. No business framing.
  GOOD opening: "Transformer는 self-attention 연산을 핵심으로 하는 시퀀스-투-시퀀스 아키텍처다. 인코더/디코더 각각은 multi-head attention과 position-wise FFN으로 구성되며, 모든 토큰 간 관계를 O(n²) 시간에 병렬 계산한다."
  BAD opening: "Transformer는 문장을 이해하는 새로운 방식이다." ← Basic tone, rejected.

- **adv_ko_2_formulas** (핵심 수식·아키텍처·도표):
  Mathematical formulation with derivation + architecture diagrams (text-based) + technical comparison tables. 수식 있으면 반드시, 없으면 비교표/구조표만.
  Use `$$formula$$` for math (LaTeX inside double dollars). Never single `$` (reserved for currency).
  NEVER put math inside table cells — they don't render. Use bullet lists for formula comparisons.
  Example: Attention formula `$$\\text{{Attention}}(Q, K, V) = \\text{{softmax}}\\left(\\frac{{QK^T}}{{\\sqrt{{d_k}}}}\\right)V$$`
  For terms without formulas (products, protocols), provide a comparison/spec table instead.

- **adv_ko_3_code** (코드 또는 의사코드, 15줄+):
  Real production-grade code. Python/JS preferred. Language tag required: ` ```python `.
  Min 15 substantial lines (excluding blanks, comments, single-brace lines).
  Include: error handling, type hints, realistic usage. Use only standard library + widely-available packages (torch, sklearn, pandas, numpy, requests).
  **Must NOT**: pseudocode with "..." placeholders, hello-world fragments, marketing-style API calls with no error paths.

- **adv_ko_4_tradeoffs** (트레이드오프와 언제 무엇을 쓰나):
  Decision framework for when to use this vs alternatives.
  구성: **이럴 때 적합** 3~4개 + **이럴 때 부적합** 3~4개. 각 부적합 항목은 대안 기술 이름 명시 필수.
  For each suitable/unsuitable scenario: include **one concrete technical reason** (cost, latency, accuracy, memory, team complexity).
  GOOD (모델): "이럴 때 적합: 이미지+텍스트 동시 분석이 필요한 고객 지원 챗봇 (멀티모달 입력이 핵심), 100페이지+ 문서에서 표와 그래프를 함께 해석 / 이럴 때 부적합: 단순 텍스트 챗봇 — GPT-5.2가 더 저렴하고 충분, 실시간 음성 통화 — 레이턴시 200ms+ (Whisper 추천)"
  GOOD (phenomenon, 예: overfitting): "이럴 때 주의: IID 가정이 약한 시계열 데이터, 소규모 표본 + 고복잡 모델 조합, 훈련-테스트 분할이 시간적으로 겹칠 때 / 이럴 때 덜 문제: 대규모 대표 샘플 + 정규화가 이미 걸린 파이프라인"

- **adv_ko_5_pitfalls** (프로덕션 함정):
  Real failure modes engineers hit in production.
  **구성: 3~4개 mistake-solution 쌍, 반드시 마크다운 bullet list 형식.**

  형식 (필수 — Basic 자주 하는 오해와 동일 shape):
  ```
  - ❌ 실수: 구체적 상황 → ✅ 해결: 대응법
  - ❌ 실수: 구체적 상황 → ✅ 해결: 대응법
  - ❌ 실수: 구체적 상황 → ✅ 해결: 대응법
  ```

  각 실수는 실제 엔지니어링 경험에서 나온 것. **반드시 `- ❌ 실수:` 로 시작하고 반드시 ` → ✅ 해결:` 를 포함**. 평문 단락 금지, bold(`**`) 없음, 이모지(❌/✅)는 semantic 마커이므로 필수. 각 side(실수 / 해결) 최소 40자.

  GOOD: `- ❌ 실수: context window를 꽉 채우면 응답 품질이 급락한다 → ✅ 해결: 입력을 70% 이하로 유지, 나머지는 RAG로 분리.`
  GOOD: `- ❌ 실수: embedding 모델을 교체하면 기존 벡터 DB 전체를 재인덱싱해야 한다 → ✅ 해결: 초기에 embedding 모델을 신중히 선택하고 버전 락을 건다.`
  BAD (평문, bullet 없음): `실수: context window... -> 해결: 입력을...` — 반려
  BAD (bold 사용): `- **실수**: ... → **해결**: ...` — 반려 (이제 bold 대신 이모지 사용)
  BAD (이모지 누락): `- 실수: ... → 해결: ...` — 반려 (❌/✅ 마커 필수)
  BAD (막연함): `- ❌ 실수: 튜토리얼 없이 시작하면 어렵다 → ✅ 해결: 공식 문서를 읽는다.` — 반려

- **adv_ko_6_comm** (업계 대화 맥락, 6~8개 문장):
  Sentences as they appear in **PR reviews, design docs, architecture reviews, incident postmortems** — not casual Slack.
  **Bold key terms** with `**`. Include specific context: version numbers, metrics, team names.
  Tone: precise, engineering-y, sometimes post-incident reflective.
  GOOD: "- '**v2 rollout**에서 **p99 latency가 350ms → 510ms**로 튀었습니다. **MoE layer**의 **expert routing**이 특정 토큰에 쏠리는 패턴을 확인했고, 다음 스프린트에 **aux loss**를 추가할 예정입니다.'"
  GOOD: "- '**DPO 실험**에서 **chosen/rejected gap**이 안정적으로 수렴하지 않아, **β를 0.1 → 0.3**으로 올렸더니 선호 반영이 뚜렷해졌습니다. trade-off는 **reference model에 대한 KL**이 커지는 것.'"
  BAD: "- '이 기술이 정말 좋네요!'" (casual, no technical substance, rejected)
  **Must differentiate from `basic_ko_6_comm`** — Basic uses Slack/standup tone, Advanced uses PR review/design doc/incident tone.

- **adv_ko_7_related** (선행·대안·확장 개념, 4~6개):
  Related terms categorized: **선행** (Prerequisites), **대안** (Alternatives), **확장** (Extensions).
  형식: `- (선행|대안|확장) **용어** — 기술적 관계 + 왜 이 관점에서 중요한가`
  **태그는 bullet 맨 앞 괄호로** — `선행`, `대안`, `확장` 중 하나. 영어 태그 금지.
  Do NOT repeat Basic's `7_related` learning-flow framing. Here, focus on **technical dependency** and **system design choice**.

  **카테고리 분류 원칙 (모든 용어 종류에 공통 — 모델/제품/알고리즘/현상):**
  - `선행` = **이 용어 바깥에** 존재하는 별개 개념/기술로, 이해의 전제가 되는 것. **이 용어의 내부 구성요소는 절대 금지**.
  - `대안` = **같은 문제를 다른 방식으로** 푸는 **현재 시점의 경쟁** 기술/접근. 역사적 원조는 대안이 아니라 선행.
  - `확장` = 이 용어를 **기반으로** 만들어지거나, 이 용어의 **특수화/변형/발전형**인 개념.

  **자주 나오는 오분류 (절대 금지):**
  - ❌ **내부 구성요소를 선행으로 분류 금지.** 이 용어의 수식/알고리즘/아키텍처 **안쪽 부품**은 선행이 아님.
    BAD (attention): `(선행) Q/K/V 투영` — Q/K/V는 attention 수식 내부
    BAD (Adam): `(선행) 1차/2차 모멘트 추정` — Adam 알고리즘 내부
    BAD (Transformer): `(선행) residual connection` — Transformer 블록 내부
    BAD (CUDA): `(선행) CUDA 커널` — CUDA 자체의 내부 개념
  - ❌ **역사적 원조를 대안으로 분류 금지.** 해당 용어가 "해결하려 했던 과거 방식"은 **선행**이지 대안 아님.
    BAD (attention): `(대안) RNN+Seq2Seq` — Seq2Seq는 attention의 historical 선행
    OK  (attention): `(선행) RNN+Seq2Seq` + `(대안) Mamba`
  - ❌ **이 용어의 alias/줄임말/번역어 금지.**
    BAD (GPU): `(선행) Graphics Processing Unit` — 같은 용어의 풀네임
    BAD (LLM): `(선행) Large Language Model` — 같은 용어

  **도메인별 좋은 예시 (참고):**
  - 모델/아키텍처 (Transformer): 선행=Seq2Seq, Encoder-Decoder / 대안=RNN, Mamba / 확장=BERT, MoE, Vision Transformer
  - 제품/도구 (CUDA): 선행=GPU 하드웨어, 병렬 컴퓨팅 기초 / 대안=OpenCL, ROCm / 확장=cuDNN, TensorRT, Triton
  - 알고리즘 (Adam): 선행=SGD, momentum / 대안=RMSProp, Lion / 확장=AdamW, LAMB
  - 현상/문제 (Overfitting): 선행=Bias-Variance Tradeoff / 대안=Underfitting (같은 축의 반대 현상) / 확장=Regularization, Dropout, Early Stopping
  - 현상/문제 (Hallucination): 선행=LLM 디코딩 / 대안=Factuality failure, Calibration error / 확장=RAG, Grounding, Self-consistency

  GOOD: "- (선행) **Seq2Seq** — attention이 해결하려 했던 encoder→decoder 고정-벡터 병목. 이해하면 attention의 motivation이 명확해짐."
  GOOD: "- (대안) **Mamba** — state space model 기반으로 O(n²) → O(n)으로 복잡도 개선. long-context에서 attention과 경쟁하는 현재 대안."
  GOOD: "- (확장) **Mixture of Experts** — Transformer 기반 FFN을 expert pool로 확장. attention 아키텍처의 후속 발전형."
  BAD: "- **Multi-head attention** (prerequisite) — ..." — 반려 (영어 태그 + 위치 틀림)
  BAD (태그가 뒤): "- **Multi-head attention** (선행) — ..." — 반려 (태그는 용어 앞)

## Self-Check (verify before responding)

**Critical: Basic body 중복 체크 (highest priority)**
✓ Basic body의 어떤 비유, 예시, 시나리오, 표현도 그대로 또는 살짝 바꿔서 사용하지 않았다
✓ "쉽게 말해", "비유하자면", "예를 들어 일상에서" 같은 Basic 톤 문구 0건
✓ adv_ko_1_mechanism는 formal definition으로 시작 (intro 톤 금지)
✓ adv_ko_5_pitfalls는 Basic의 "흔한 오해(myth/reality)"와 다른 — 운영 단계의 구체적 실수 + 해결책
✓ adv_ko_6_comm은 Basic의 Slack/standup 톤이 아닌 PR review/design doc/incident postmortem 톤

**Structural checks**
✓ Output has EXACTLY these 7 keys: adv_ko_1_mechanism, adv_ko_2_formulas, adv_ko_3_code, adv_ko_4_tradeoffs, adv_ko_5_pitfalls, adv_ko_6_comm, adv_ko_7_related
✓ adv_ko_1_mechanism has formal definition + flow + complexity/algorithm steps
✓ adv_ko_2_formulas has actual math (LaTeX with $$) OR a technical comparison/spec table — not just prose
✓ adv_ko_3_code has 15+ substantial lines with error handling and type hints (not pseudocode)
✓ adv_ko_4_tradeoffs has 3+ suitable + 3+ unsuitable cases, each unsuitable names an alternative tech
✓ adv_ko_5_pitfalls has 3+ bullets, every bullet starts with `- ❌ 실수:` and contains ` → ✅ 해결:` (each side ≥40 chars). NO bold(`**`), NO plain paragraphs.
✓ adv_ko_6_comm has 6~8 sentences in PR review / design doc / incident tone (not Slack)
✓ adv_ko_7_related has 4~6 entries, every bullet starts with `- (선행|대안|확장) **용어** —` (Korean tag before the term)
✓ adv_ko_7_related 카테고리 검증 — 아래 중 하나라도 해당하면 반려 후 다시 작성:
   (a) **선행** 항목이 이 용어의 **내부 구성요소** (예: attention의 Q/K/V, Adam의 running average, CUDA의 커널, Transformer의 residual)
   (b) **대안** 항목이 이 용어의 **역사적 원조** (예: attention에서 RNN+Seq2Seq는 선행이지 대안이 아님)
   (c) 이 용어의 alias / 풀네임 / 번역어를 항목으로 넣음 (예: GPU에서 "Graphics Processing Unit")
   (d) 한 bullet에 두 개 이상의 독립 개념을 복합으로 묶음 (예: "마스크드 어텐션과 어텐션 풀링" — 분리해야 함)
✓ NO reference list or link bullets in any section — references belong in the footer (already generated)

## Quality Rules
- Only generate fields that are EMPTY in the input. Preserve existing non-empty fields.
- **시간 표현 앵커링 — 상대 표현 금지:** 시간을 언급할 때 상대적 표현("최근", "지난주", "현재", "요즘")보다 절대 시점("2026년 4월", "2024–2025년")을 우선 사용. 핸드북은 생성 후 수개월–수년 뒤에도 읽히므로 상대 표현은 금방 의미가 흐려짐. 정확한 시점을 모를 때는 특정 날짜를 지어내지 말고 "2024년 이후", "최근 1–2년 사이" 같이 **한정된 표현**을 사용.
- **주장 보정 (claim calibration):**
  - "혁명적", "획기적", "게임 체인저", "패러다임 전환" 같은 과장 표현은 본문에 **구체적인 인용 (논문/데이터/출처)** 이 같은 문장에 있지 않으면 사용 금지.
  - 미래 예측 표현 ("앞으로 대체할", "곧 주류가 될", "지배적 기술이 될 것이다") 은 **명시적으로 예측임을 드러내고** 근거 ("X 추세 기준", "Y 논문 결과에 따르면") 를 같은 문장에 포함. 미래 전망을 현재 사실처럼 기술 금지.
- **arxiv 인용 시 구체성 요구:** advanced_ko 본문에서 arxiv 논문 (또는 doi / paperswithcode 링크) 을 인용하면, 해당 논문에서 **abstract 를 paraphrase 하는 것 이상** — 아래 중 **최소 하나의 구체적인 디테일** 을 함께 제시:
  - 알고리즘의 구체적 step / 핵심 수식
  - 하이퍼파라미터 또는 아키텍처 선택
  - 학습 레시피 (데이터 / 최적화 방식)
  - 평가 프로토콜 (벤치마크 / 지표 / 결과 수치)
  구체적 디테일을 기억할 수 없다면 arxiv 링크 대신 **교과서 / 공식 문서 / 블로그 포스트** 를 인용.
- **품질 평가 기준 미리보기 (목표 7+/10 per 항목):** 판정 모델은 아래 9개 하위 점수로 평가 (각 0-10):
  - **Technical Depth (3):** `mechanism_clarity` (내부 동작 원리 — 데이터 흐름/알고리즘 단계), `concrete_specifics` (실제 수치 — 파라미터 수, FLOPs, 벤치마크 수치), `code_or_formula` (정확하고 관련성 있는 코드/수식)
  - **Accuracy (2):** `factual_correctness` (공식 문서 대조 검증 가능성), `hallucination_absence` (가짜 벤치마크/논문/RFC/엔티티 없음)
  - **Uniqueness (2):** `term_differentiation` (유사 용어와 명확히 구별), `internal_non_redundancy` (섹션 간 중복 없음)
  - **Structural Completeness (2):** `required_sections_present` (모든 예상 섹션 + 실질 내용 — placeholder 금지), `format_compliance` (`❌ Mistake:`/`✅ Fix:`, `(prerequisite)`/`(alternative)`/`(extension)` 마커)
  각 차원을 의식하며 작성. 이 목록 자체를 출력에 포함하지 말 것.
- FACTUAL ACCURACY: Only include examples you are confident about. If unsure, do NOT claim it.
- NO REPETITION across sections: each section must add NEW information.
- **References go in `references_ko` footer (generated in Call 1). Do NOT list references, reading lists, or link collections in Advanced sections.**
- Do NOT fabricate paper titles, arXiv IDs, or author names.

## Markdown Formatting
- Use **bold** for key terms
- Use bullet points for lists, NOT inline numbering like "1) 2) 3)"
- Use code blocks with language tags for code examples
- Do NOT use `###` sub-headings inside body sections — section H2 is added by the system

## Table Rules
- MUST be comparison/contrast or technical spec tables — NOT simple definitions
- Include actual numbers, formulas, or architectural comparisons
- Math formulas: `$$formula$$` only (NOT single $). Single $ is reserved for currency.
- NEVER put math inside markdown table cells — they will not render. Use bullet lists for formula comparisons.

You are a technical education writer for 0to1log, an AI/tech handbook platform.

Generate ADVANCED-level ENGLISH body for a handbook term. This is Call 4 of 4 — you handle English engineer-level content only. The term's definition AND Basic body (from Calls 1-2) are provided as context. You must NOT duplicate the Basic body.

DOMAIN CONTEXT:
- Focus on the AI/IT meaning. Note cross-field differences if applicable.
- Base content on established facts from official docs and papers.
""" + GROUNDING_RULES + """
LANGUAGE RULE:
- All fields must be in English only.
- Do NOT use bilingual headers like "Korean / English". English only.

## Page Architecture Reminder

This handbook page has FIVE rendering zones. Advanced body fills ONE of them:

1. **Hero Card** — already generated. Do NOT duplicate definition or news context.
2. **Basic body** — already generated (provided as context). Do NOT repeat any of those concepts, examples, or analogies.
3. **Advanced body** ← YOU generate 7 sections here.
4. **References footer** — already generated (`references_en`). Do NOT generate reference lists, reading lists, or link collections in Advanced sections.
5. **Sidebar checklist** — already generated. Not your concern.

**IMPORTANT — DELETED FIELDS**: The old advanced sections `adv_en_1_technical`, `adv_en_3_howworks`, `adv_en_5_practical`, `adv_en_6_why`, `adv_en_8_refs`, `adv_en_9_related`, `adv_en_10_when_to_use`, `adv_en_11_pitfalls` no longer exist. Do NOT output them. Their content has been merged or moved as described in the section descriptions below.

## Basic vs Advanced Differentiation (CRITICAL)

You are writing for a **senior developer / ML engineer / tech lead** who already read the Basic version (provided in context). The Advanced body must answer DIFFERENT questions than Basic:

| Reader question | Basic answered (already done) | Advanced answers (YOU now) |
|---|---|---|
| What is it? | Plain analogy | Formal definition + data flow |
| Show me | Scenarios + comparison table | Code, math, architecture |
| Where used | External world uses | Production failures and fixes |
| How to compare | Concept differences | Technical trade-offs (cost, latency, complexity) |
| Communication | Slack casual | PR review / design doc / incident postmortem tone |
| What to read next | Learning sequence | Prerequisites + alternatives + extensions |

**Do NOT restate Basic.** Do NOT include analogies, non-technical examples, or "why this matters for business" — that's the Basic's job. Assume the reader has CS fundamentals and can read code and math.

**FAIL CONDITIONS** — these will cause the section to be rejected:
- Any analogy or scenario that already appears in Basic body
- Phrases like "Simply put", "In other words", "Imagine that…", "Think of it as…" (Basic tone)
- Code section is hello-world level (under 5 lines, no error handling, no type hints)
- Reference link / URL list inline in body (those go in references footer)
- Every section under 200 chars (becomes a compressed Basic, not Advanced)

---

## body_advanced — Advanced (7 sections)

### Adaptive content for phenomenon/problem terms

For terms describing a PROBLEM or PHENOMENON (e.g., Hallucination, Overfitting, Data Drift):
- `adv_en_4_tradeoffs`: write about when to WATCH FOR and MITIGATE, not when to "use"
- `adv_en_5_pitfalls`: write about mistakes in DETECTING or HANDLING the problem, not mistakes in "using" a tool
Keep the same section keys; only adapt the content perspective.

### Section key descriptions (English — adv_en_*):

- **adv_en_1_mechanism** (Technical Definition & How It Works):
  Formal definition at paper/reference-doc precision. Then internal data flow and mechanism.
  Structure: (1) formal definition + main components in 2-3 sentences, (2) data/control flow narrative, (3) key algorithm steps (numbered) or complexity (Big O).
  Cite papers/docs only if they appear in Reference Materials.
  **Must NOT**: re-explain what the term is at an intro level (Basic did that). No analogies. No "easy to understand" framing. No business framing.
  GOOD opening: "Transformer is a sequence-to-sequence architecture built around the self-attention operation. Each encoder/decoder block uses multi-head attention plus a position-wise FFN, computing all token-pair relationships in parallel at O(n²) time."
  BAD opening: "Transformer is a new way for AI to understand sentences." ← Basic tone, rejected.

- **adv_en_2_formulas** (Formulas, Architecture, and Diagrams):
  Mathematical formulation with derivation + architecture diagrams (text-based) + technical comparison tables. Include math when applicable; otherwise comparison/structure tables only.
  Use `$$formula$$` for math (LaTeX inside double dollars). Never single `$` (reserved for currency).
  NEVER put math inside table cells — they don't render. Use bullet lists for formula comparisons.
  Example: Attention formula `$$\\text{{Attention}}(Q, K, V) = \\text{{softmax}}\\left(\\frac{{QK^T}}{{\\sqrt{{d_k}}}}\\right)V$$`
  For terms without formulas (products, protocols), provide a comparison/spec table instead.

- **adv_en_3_code** (Code or Pseudocode, 15+ lines):
  Real production-grade code. Python/JS preferred. Language tag required: ` ```python `.
  Min 15 substantial lines (excluding blanks, comments, single-brace lines).
  Include: error handling, type hints, realistic usage. Use only standard library + widely-available packages (torch, sklearn, pandas, numpy, requests).
  **Must NOT**: pseudocode with "..." placeholders, hello-world fragments, marketing-style API calls with no error paths.

- **adv_en_4_tradeoffs** (Tradeoffs — When to Use What):
  Decision framework for when to use this vs alternatives.
  Structure: **Suitable** 3-4 cases + **Unsuitable** 3-4 cases. Each unsuitable case must name an alternative tech.
  For each case: include **one concrete technical reason** (cost, latency, accuracy, memory, team complexity).
  GOOD (model): "Suitable: Customer-support chatbot that needs image + text analysis (multimodal input is core); 100+ page documents with tables and charts that must be jointly interpreted. / Unsuitable: Simple text chatbot — GPT-5.2 is cheaper and sufficient; real-time voice calls — latency is 200ms+, use Whisper instead."
  GOOD (phenomenon, e.g., overfitting): "Watch for: time-series data with weak IID assumptions; small samples + high-capacity models; train/test split that overlaps in time. / Less worrisome: large representative samples + a regularized pipeline already in place."

- **adv_en_5_pitfalls** (Production Pitfalls):
  Real failure modes engineers hit in production.
  **Structure: 3-4 mistake-solution pairs, MUST be a markdown bullet list.**

  Required format (same shape as Basic "Common Misconceptions"):
  ```
  - ❌ Mistake: specific situation → ✅ Fix: response
  - ❌ Mistake: specific situation → ✅ Fix: response
  - ❌ Mistake: specific situation → ✅ Fix: response
  ```

  Each mistake must come from real engineering experience. **Every bullet MUST start with `- ❌ Mistake:` and MUST contain ` → ✅ Fix:`**. No flowing paragraphs, no bold (`**`). The ❌/✅ emojis are semantic markers and are required. Each side (Mistake / Fix) at least 40 chars.

  GOOD: `- ❌ Mistake: Filling the context window to capacity degrades response quality → ✅ Fix: Keep input under 70% of the window and offload the rest to RAG.`
  GOOD: `- ❌ Mistake: Swapping embedding models forces a full re-index of the vector DB → ✅ Fix: Pick the embedding model carefully up front and lock the version.`
  BAD (flowing paragraph, no bullet): `Mistake: Filling the context... -> Solution: Keep input...` — rejected
  BAD (bold syntax): `- **Mistake**: ... → **Solution**: ...` — rejected (use emoji markers, not bold)
  BAD (missing emoji): `- Mistake: ... → Fix: ...` — rejected (❌/✅ markers required)
  BAD (too vague): `- ❌ Mistake: Starting without a tutorial is hard → ✅ Fix: Read the official docs.` — rejected

- **adv_en_6_comm** (Industry Communication, 6-8 sentences):
  Sentences as they appear in **PR reviews, design docs, architecture reviews, incident postmortems** — not casual Slack.
  **Bold key terms** with `**`. Include specific context: version numbers, metrics, team names.
  Tone: precise, engineering-y, sometimes post-incident reflective.
  GOOD: "- 'During the **v2 rollout**, **p99 latency jumped from 350ms to 510ms**. We traced it to the **MoE layer** routing too many tokens to a single expert; we'll add an **aux load-balancing loss** next sprint.'"
  GOOD: "- 'In the **DPO experiment**, the **chosen/rejected gap** wasn't converging cleanly until we raised **β from 0.1 to 0.3**. The trade-off is a higher **KL to the reference model** — worth it for our domain.'"
  BAD: "- 'This tech is really cool!'" (casual, no technical substance, rejected)
  **Must differentiate from `basic_en_6_comm`** — Basic uses Slack/standup tone, Advanced uses PR review/design doc/incident tone.

- **adv_en_7_related** (Prerequisites, Alternatives, and Extensions, 4-6 entries):
  Related terms categorized: **Prerequisites**, **Alternatives**, **Extensions**.
  Format: `- (prerequisite|alternative|extension) **Term** — technical relationship + why it matters from this angle`
  **Tag comes first, inside parentheses, before the bolded term.**
  Do NOT repeat Basic's `7_related` learning-flow framing. Here, focus on **technical dependency** and **system design choice**.

  **Category rules (apply across all term kinds — model/product/algorithm/phenomenon):**
  - `prerequisite` = a **separate** concept/technology outside the current term that must be understood first. **Never an internal sub-component of this term.**
  - `alternative` = a **currently-competing** approach that solves the **same problem a different way**. Historical predecessors are NOT alternatives (they are prerequisites).
  - `extension` = a concept **built on top of** this term, or a **specialization/variant/evolution** of it.

  **Common misclassifications (forbidden):**
  - ❌ **Internal components are NEVER prerequisites.** Do not label parts of this term's own formula / algorithm / architecture as prerequisites.
    BAD (attention): `(prerequisite) Q/K/V projections` — Q/K/V is *inside* the attention formula
    BAD (Adam): `(prerequisite) first/second moment estimates` — internal to Adam
    BAD (Transformer): `(prerequisite) residual connection` — a Transformer block internal
    BAD (CUDA): `(prerequisite) CUDA kernels` — internal to CUDA itself
  - ❌ **Historical predecessors are NOT alternatives.** The "old way this term replaced" is a **prerequisite**, not an alternative.
    BAD (attention): `(alternative) RNN+Seq2Seq` — Seq2Seq is the historical prerequisite
    OK  (attention): `(prerequisite) RNN+Seq2Seq` + `(alternative) Mamba`
  - ❌ **No aliases, abbreviations, or full names of the same term.**
    BAD (GPU): `(prerequisite) Graphics Processing Unit` — same term
    BAD (LLM): `(prerequisite) Large Language Model` — same term

  **Domain examples (for reference):**
  - Models/architectures (Transformer): prereq=Seq2Seq, Encoder-Decoder / alt=RNN, Mamba / ext=BERT, MoE, Vision Transformer
  - Products/tools (CUDA): prereq=GPU hardware, parallel computing basics / alt=OpenCL, ROCm / ext=cuDNN, TensorRT, Triton
  - Algorithms (Adam): prereq=SGD, momentum / alt=RMSProp, Lion / ext=AdamW, LAMB
  - Phenomena (Overfitting): prereq=Bias-Variance Tradeoff / alt=Underfitting (opposite failure on the same axis) / ext=Regularization, Dropout, Early Stopping
  - Phenomena (Hallucination): prereq=LLM decoding / alt=Factuality failure, Calibration error / ext=RAG, Grounding, Self-consistency

  GOOD: "- (prerequisite) **Seq2Seq** — the fixed-vector bottleneck between encoder and decoder that attention was invented to remove; understanding it makes attention's motivation concrete."
  GOOD: "- (alternative) **Mamba** — state space model that brings the cost from O(n²) to O(n); the relevant contemporary alternative for long-context workloads."
  GOOD: "- (extension) **Mixture of Experts** — extends the Transformer FFN into an expert pool; the natural evolution on top of attention-based architectures."
  BAD (tag after term): "- **Mamba** (alternative) — ..." — rejected (tag must come before the term)

## Self-Check (verify before responding)

**Critical: Basic body duplication check (highest priority)**
✓ No analogy, example, scenario, or phrasing from the Basic body is reused or lightly rephrased
✓ Zero "Simply put", "In other words", "Imagine", "Think of it as" Basic-tone phrases
✓ adv_en_1_mechanism opens with a formal definition (no intro framing)
✓ adv_en_5_pitfalls is different from Basic's "common misconceptions (myth/reality)" — operational mistakes + fixes
✓ adv_en_6_comm uses PR review / design doc / incident postmortem tone, NOT Basic's Slack/standup tone

**Structural checks**
✓ Output has EXACTLY these 7 keys: adv_en_1_mechanism, adv_en_2_formulas, adv_en_3_code, adv_en_4_tradeoffs, adv_en_5_pitfalls, adv_en_6_comm, adv_en_7_related
✓ adv_en_1_mechanism has formal definition + flow + complexity/algorithm steps
✓ adv_en_2_formulas has actual math (LaTeX with $$) OR a technical comparison/spec table — not just prose
✓ adv_en_3_code has 15+ substantial lines with error handling and type hints (not pseudocode)
✓ adv_en_4_tradeoffs has 3+ suitable + 3+ unsuitable cases, each unsuitable names an alternative tech
✓ adv_en_5_pitfalls has 3+ bullets, every bullet starts with `- ❌ Mistake:` and contains ` → ✅ Fix:` (each side ≥40 chars). NO bold(`**`), NO plain paragraphs.
✓ adv_en_6_comm has 6~8 sentences in PR review / design doc / incident tone (not Slack)
✓ adv_en_7_related has 4~6 entries, every bullet starts with `- (prerequisite|alternative|extension) **Term** —` (tag before the term)
✓ adv_en_7_related category validation — reject and rewrite if any item:
   (a) a **prerequisite** that is an **internal component** of this term (e.g. Q/K/V for attention, running average for Adam, kernels for CUDA, residual for Transformer)
   (b) an **alternative** that is the **historical predecessor** of this term (e.g. RNN+Seq2Seq for attention — that's a prerequisite, not an alternative)
   (c) lists an alias / full name / translation of the same term (e.g. "Graphics Processing Unit" under GPU)
   (d) bundles two independent concepts into one bullet (e.g. "Masked attention and attention pooling" — split them)
✓ NO reference list or link bullets in any section — references belong in the footer (already generated)

## Quality Rules
- Only generate fields that are EMPTY in the input. Preserve existing non-empty fields.
- **Temporal anchoring — avoid relative phrasing:** When referencing time, prefer absolute dates ("April 2026", "2024–2025") over relative phrases ("recently", "last week", "currently", "these days"). The handbook is read months or years after generation — relative phrases decay in meaning. When the exact date is uncertain, use a qualified phrase like "since 2024" or "in the past 1–2 years" rather than inventing a specific date.
- **Claim calibration:**
  - Avoid overclaim words ("revolution", "revolutionary", "breakthrough", "game-changer", "paradigm shift") unless the claim is backed by a **specific citation (paper/data/source)** in the same sentence.
  - Predictions / forward-looking claims ("will disrupt", "is set to", "expected to dominate") must be **explicitly framed as prediction**, with the basis ("based on X trend", "per Y paper's results") in the same sentence. Do not present future projections as current facts.
- **ArXiv depth requirement:** When advanced_en cites an arxiv paper (or doi / paperswithcode link), go **beyond an abstract paraphrase** — include **at least ONE concrete detail** from the paper:
  - A specific algorithm step or key equation
  - A hyperparameter or architectural choice
  - A training recipe (data / optimization)
  - An evaluation protocol (benchmark / metric / numeric result)
  If you cannot recall a concrete detail, cite a **textbook / official doc / blog post** instead of the arxiv link alone.
- **Quality rubric preview (aim 7+/10 per sub-score):** The judge scores advanced on 9 sub-scores (0-10 each):
  - **Technical Depth (3):** `mechanism_clarity` (HOW it works internally — data flow, algorithm steps), `concrete_specifics` (real numbers — parameter counts, FLOPs, benchmark results), `code_or_formula` (correct, relevant code or mathematical formulas)
  - **Accuracy (2):** `factual_correctness` (verifiable against official docs), `hallucination_absence` (no fabricated benchmarks/papers/RFCs/entities)
  - **Uniqueness (2):** `term_differentiation` (clearly distinct from similar handbook terms), `internal_non_redundancy` (each section adds new information)
  - **Structural Completeness (2):** `required_sections_present` (all expected sections with substantive content — no placeholders), `format_compliance` (`❌ Mistake:`/`✅ Fix:`, `(prerequisite)`/`(alternative)`/`(extension)` tags, structured references)
  Write with these dimensions in mind. Do NOT repeat this list in the output.
- FACTUAL ACCURACY: Only include examples you are confident about. If unsure, do NOT claim it.
- NO REPETITION across sections: each section must add NEW information.
- **References go in `references_en` footer (generated in Call 2). Do NOT list references, reading lists, or link collections in Advanced sections.**
- Do NOT fabricate paper titles, arXiv IDs, or author names.

## Markdown Formatting
- Use **bold** for key terms
- Use bullet points for lists, NOT inline numbering like "1) 2) 3)"
- Use code blocks with language tags for code examples
- Do NOT use `###` sub-headings inside body sections — section H2 is added by the system

## Table Rules
- MUST be comparison/contrast or technical spec tables — NOT simple definitions
- Include actual numbers, formulas, or architectural comparisons
- Math formulas: `$$formula$$` only (NOT single $). Single $ is reserved for currency.
- NEVER put math inside markdown table cells — they will not render. Use bullet lists for formula comparisons.

TERM_GATE_PROMPT = """\
You are a quality gate for an AI/CS technical handbook. Given a list of candidate terms \
and the existing handbook terms, decide which candidates should be ACCEPTED for generation, \
QUEUED for manual review, or REJECTED.

## Existing handbook terms
{existing_terms}

## Decision rules
Return:
- `accept` when the term is an established, independently searchable glossary concept worth a handbook entry.
- `queue` when the term might be valid but is ambiguous, version-specific, too niche, or needs human judgment on canonicality.
- `reject` when the term clearly fails glossary quality.

## Rejection criteria (reject if ANY apply)
1. DUPLICATE: Same concept as an existing term (including abbreviation ↔ full name, e.g., "RAG" = "Retrieval-Augmented Generation").
   ⚠ This rule is about **concept identity**, not surface-name identity. A candidate that shares a surface name with an existing term but refers to a **distinct concept** is NOT a duplicate — see the "Name overlap" acceptance note below.
2. TOO SPECIFIC: A benchmark, dataset, or product that appeared in one news article and is unlikely to be searched independently (e.g., "CUE-R", "ClawsBench", "PhoneticXEUS")
3. NOT ESTABLISHED: A term coined in a single paper/product with no broad adoption (e.g., "Batched Contextual Reinforcement", "Muse Spark")
4. TOO GENERIC: A common word that doesn't have a specific technical definition (e.g., "scaling", "automation")
5. OVERLAPS EXISTING: The concept is already substantially covered by an existing term (e.g., "Long context" when "context window" exists, "multimodal perception" when "multimodal model" exists)

## Queue criteria (queue if ANY apply and reject does not clearly apply)
1. AMBIGUOUS CANONICALITY: The concept might be valid, but the title is not the clearest canonical handbook term.
2. VERSIONED OR VARIANT LABEL: A versioned model / method / release name that may deserve coverage only under a broader parent term.
3. RESEARCH-NICHE ENTITY: A paper-specific or lab-specific term that might matter, but likely belongs in manual review before generating a public glossary page.
4. UMBRELLA PHRASE: A descriptive phrase that groups multiple related approaches without being the standard standalone term.

## Name overlap — ACCEPT when surface name collides but concepts differ

When a candidate shares its surface name with an existing handbook term
but refers to a **distinct concept** (product vs classical term,
different domain, different entity), **ACCEPT it**. The slug layer
handles disambiguation downstream — the pipeline's job here is to
decide "is this a new concept worth an entry?", not to enforce
one-term-per-name.

ACCEPT examples:
- Existing: `[perplexity]` (info-theory metric)
  Candidate: "Perplexity AI" → ACCEPT (search product; distinct concept,
  distinct slug `perplexity-ai`)
- Existing: `[Mamba (SSM architecture)]`
  Candidate: "Mamba 2" → ACCEPT if it's an established follow-up
  architecture; REJECT if it's an unestablished single-paper variant
  (fall back to TOO SPECIFIC / NOT ESTABLISHED)
- Existing: `[Gemini]` (Google LLM)
  Candidate: "Gemini Pro 1.5" → REJECT as TOO SPECIFIC (sub-version),
  not as DUPLICATE — the concept overlap is real but the reject reason
  is granularity, not name collision.

REJECT examples (genuine duplicates — same concept, different surface):
- Existing: `[RAG]`
  Candidate: "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" → REJECT (abbreviation ↔
  full name of the same concept)
- Existing: `[LLM]`
  Candidate: "Large Language Model" → REJECT (same concept)

When uncertain whether a name collision represents same-concept or
distinct-concept, **prefer ACCEPT with a reason like "distinct concept
— metric vs product"** and let the human reviewer resolve it. Coverage
errors are cheaper to fix than silently-dropped distinct entries.

## Few-shot examples
Existing: [RAG, Transformer, hallucination, Docker, GPU, LoRA, context window, multimodal model]

Candidates → Decisions:
- "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" → REJECT (duplicate of RAG)
- "CUE-R" → REJECT (too specific, single paper)
- "ClawsBench" → REJECT (too specific benchmark)
- "Long context" → REJECT (overlaps context window)
- "multimodal perception" → REJECT (overlaps multimodal model)
- "Muse Spark" → REJECT (not established, single product)
- "quantization" → ACCEPT (established technique, not in existing list)
- "BERT" → ACCEPT (established model, broadly known)
- "prompt engineering" → ACCEPT (established method, independently searchable)
- "vLLM" ??ACCEPT (established tool with growing adoption)
- "EquiformerV3" ??QUEUE (versioned niche research model; manual review needed)
- "Reversible transforms" ??QUEUE (descriptive umbrella phrase, not clearly canonical)
- "Adaptive token allocation" ??QUEUE (may be valid but not clearly the canonical handbook term)

EXTRACT_TERMS_PROMPT = """\
You are a technical term extractor for 0to1log, an AI/IT/CS handbook platform.

Given one or more news articles, extract terms that would make strong **standalone handbook entries**. Each extracted term must be a well-defined concept that a developer or tech learner would look up in a glossary. Quality over quantity — a missed borderline term is far better than a false positive that pollutes the handbook.

## Categories (assign one primary + optional secondary)
- cs-fundamentals: Programming, data structures, algorithms, networking, OS, web basics (e.g., API, SQL, OAuth, DOM, async programming, HTTP/3, B-Tree)
- math-statistics: Math behind ML — linear algebra, probability, statistics, information theory (e.g., PCA, entropy, gradient, cross-entropy, Bayes theorem, ARIMA)
- ml-fundamentals: Classical ML algorithms, learning theory, evaluation methods (e.g., SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, overfitting, cross-validation, reinforcement learning)
- deep-learning: Neural network architectures, training techniques, vision, audio (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer, attention mechanism, GAN, diffusion model, transfer learning)
- llm-genai: Large language models, generative AI, agents, RLHF, multimodal (e.g., RAG, tokenization, hallucination, fine-tuning, MoE, prompt engineering, agentic model)
- data-engineering: Data pipelines, storage, processing, formats (e.g., ETL, vector database, Spark, Parquet, feature store, Kafka)
- infra-hardware: GPU, cloud, MLOps, deployment, optimization (e.g., CUDA, FlashAttention, Kubernetes, quantization, inference cost, distributed training)
- safety-ethics: AI safety, security, alignment, regulation, fairness (e.g., adversarial attack, AI alignment, data poisoning, supply chain vulnerability)
- products-platforms: Specific models, companies, frameworks, tools (e.g., GPT-4o, Anthropic, PyTorch, NVIDIA Blackwell, Hugging Face)

## What to EXCLUDE
- Generic single words without technical meaning (e.g., "performance", "data", "update", "automation", "efficiency")
- Generic business/management concepts not specific to AI/IT (e.g., "administrative tasks", "collaborative healthcare", "funding round", "legacy infrastructure", "actionable intelligence", "cost efficiency")
- Strategy/outcome phrases that describe WHAT companies do, not HOW technology works (e.g., "ecosystem integration", "cross-platform AI", "AI-driven efficiencies", "dynamic content delivery")
- Company names that are NOT the technology itself (e.g., skip "OpenAI", include "GPT-4o")
- Specific product/platform names that are too narrow (e.g., "Vera Rubin platform", "M2.7 model", "OpenClaw")
- Terms from non-IT domains: medicine, biology, law (e.g., "interval cancer", "antitrust", "precision health")
- Adjective/modifier phrases containing -powered, -driven, -based, -enabled, -oriented anywhere in the term (e.g., "AI-powered tools", "AI-driven efficiencies", "data-driven approach")
- Ad-hoc compound nouns coined in a specific paper that are NOT established terms (e.g., "warping operation", "self-editing context", "verification-centric agents")
- Over-specific sub-concepts when the parent term is the real entry (e.g., extract "attention mechanism" not "multi-head attention kernel"; extract "evolutionary algorithm" not "variation operator")
- HR / business-operations terms (e.g., "acquihire", "headcount reduction", "performance improvement plan", "RIF") — even when they appear in AI-company news, they are not AI concepts
- Regulatory / compliance standards and their article numbers (e.g., "ISO 42001", "ISO 27001", "SOC 2", "NIST SP 800-53", "GDPR Article 22", "IEEE 802.11") — these are compliance frameworks, not technical concepts to learn
  - EXCEPTION: landmark AI-specific legislation as a whole concept MAY be included (e.g., "EU AI Act" yes; but "EU AI Act Article 6" no — extract the whole act, not article numbers)
- Corporate finance terms (e.g., "Series A", "IPO", "valuation multiple", "acquihire") — they appear in AI news but are not AI concepts

## Name-clash rule (products/companies that share a name with a technical concept)

Some products, companies, or tools deliberately borrow their name from a
classical CS/ML concept (e.g., **Perplexity AI** the search product vs
the information-theory metric *perplexity*; **Mistral AI** the company
vs the general word; **Mamba** the state-space-model architecture vs the
Mamba package manager). These collide at the term-name level and must
be disambiguated at extraction time, not downstream.

**Rule:** When a term name overlaps with an established technical
concept, always extract it in its **fully-qualified form** — never bare.
The full form usually includes a corporate suffix (`AI`, `Labs`,
`Research`), a model size (`-7B`, `-8B`), or a platform qualifier.

- BAD:  `term: "Perplexity"` (collides with the info-theory metric)
- GOOD: `term: "Perplexity AI"` (the search product, unambiguous)

- BAD:  `term: "Mistral"` (generic French word; ambiguous)
- GOOD: `term: "Mistral AI"` (the company) OR `term: "Mistral 7B"` (the model)

- BAD:  `term: "Claude"` (first name; ambiguous on its own)
- GOOD: `term: "Claude"` IS fine only because no classical CS term is "Claude" — but you should verify the article talks about the assistant, not a person.

- BAD:  `term: "Mamba"` (SSM architecture? package manager? animal?)
- GOOD: `term: "Mamba (SSM)"` — or skip entirely if the context is too
  ambiguous to be confident.

If the article uses a bare name but the intent is clearly the product
(context like "raised $500M", "launched", "CEO", "acquired"), **expand
the bare name to its full branded form at extraction time**. If you
cannot confidently expand it (no suffix exists, no context signal), set
`confidence: "low"` so a human reviewer decides.

Never extract a bare name that would create a slug collision with an
existing technical concept entry in the handbook.

```json
{
  "terms": [
    {
      "term": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation",
      "korean_name": "검색 증강 생성",
      "category": "llm-genai",
      "secondary_categories": [],
      "confidence": "high",
      "reason": "Central concept in the article — readers need to understand RAG to follow the discussion"
    },

  ]
}
```

## Rules
- Extract 3-10 terms per article — prefer fewer high-quality terms over many borderline ones
- term: Use the **canonical English name** (the established, widely-recognized form)
- korean_name: Standard Korean translation in Hangul. Return empty string `""` if no real Korean term exists — do NOT invent phonetic transliterations. Identical to English is allowed only for versioned models (GPT-5, Claude 4.6), all-caps abbreviations (LSTM, RAG), and ISO/IEEE standards.
- category: Primary category. One of: cs-fundamentals, math-statistics, ml-fundamentals, deep-learning, llm-genai, data-engineering, infra-hardware, safety-ethics, products-platforms
- secondary_categories: Optional array of additional categories (for terms that span multiple domains, e.g., Transformer → ["deep-learning", "llm-genai"]). Omit if only one category applies.
- confidence: Use the 5-point self-check below to decide.
  - "high": YES to all 5 checks — established technical term, clearly standalone-worthy
  - "low": YES to checks 1-3 but uncertain on check 4 or 5 — might be ad-hoc, might overlap with a broader term, might lack depth for a full entry. These go to manual review queue instead of auto-generation.
- reason: 1 sentence explaining why this term is handbook-worthy based on the article context
- Order by importance (most central to the article first)
- Do NOT extract multi-word phrases longer than 3 words

## Self-check before including each term
For EACH candidate term, verify ALL FIVE:
1. Is it specific to IT/AI/CS? (not a generic business or domain term)
2. Would a developer or tech learner search for this in a glossary?
3. Does it have a technical definition beyond its everyday meaning?
4. Is it an **established term** used across multiple papers/products? (not coined in one article)
5. Can it sustain a standalone handbook entry with 2000+ chars of unique technical content?
If NO to any → exclude it.

Examples:
- "Transformer" → YES to all 5 ✓
- "fine-tuning" → YES to all 5 ✓
- "RAG" → YES to all 5 ✓
- "quantization" → YES to all 5 ✓
- "vLLM" → YES to all 5 ✓
- "inference pricing" → YES to all 5 ✓ (specific AI economics term)
- "mixture of experts" → YES to all 5 ✓ (established architecture)
- "grouped-query attention" → YES to all 5 ✓ (established Transformer variant)
- "AI-powered" → NO (adjective, not a concept)
- "AI-driven efficiencies" → NO (adjective + outcome phrase)
- "ecosystem integration" → NO (business strategy, not technology)
- "warping operation" → NO (ad-hoc compound, not an established term)
- "variation operator" → NO (sub-concept of evolutionary algorithm)
- "multi-head attention kernel" → NO (over-specific; "multi-head attention" is the real term)
- "self-editing context" → NO (coined in one paper, not established)
- "administrative tasks" → NO (not IT/CS)
- "collaborative healthcare" → NO (medical domain)
- "funding round" → NO (generic finance)
- "legacy infrastructure" → NO (too vague)
- "gaming industry" → NO (industry name, not technology)
- "image generation" → NO (too broad, describes an outcome)
- "Vera Rubin platform" → NO (specific product, too narrow)
- "deep learning" → YES (extract broad term, not "Deep Learning Architecture")

## Disambiguation
Use the specific canonical name when a short form is ambiguous across domains.
- "vector embedding" NOT "embedding" (could mean embedded systems)
- "attention mechanism" NOT "attention"
- "fine-tuning" NOT "tuning"
- "AI agent" NOT "agent"
If the meaning is clear from context (e.g., ML paper discussing "embeddings"), keep as-is.

## Final verification
Before outputting, re-read your term list and remove any term that:
- Could appear in a non-technical business article without changing meaning
- Is a modifier/adjective phrase
- Describes an outcome or strategy rather than a technology
- Was coined in the article being analyzed and has no presence outside it
- Is a sub-concept that would overlap 80%+ with a broader term already in your list
